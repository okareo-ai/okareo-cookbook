For small n, say 100, and assuming for the sake of example that the computer does 1012 operations each second, the program would run for about 4 \u00d7 1010 years, which is the same order of magnitude as the age of the universe. Even with a much faster computer, the program would only be useful for very small instances and in that sense the intractability of a problem is somewhat independent of technological progress. Nevertheless, a polynomial time algorithm is not always practical. If its running time is, say, n15, it is unreasonable to consider it efficient and it is still useless except on small instances.", "question_id": "56e1fc57e3433e1400423230", "passage_id": "1bffc4e4-addc-44df-92a9-be07af37a2d7", "answer": "NP-complete problems", "title": "Computational_complexity_theory"}

For time and space requirements, the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively. They are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources.

To show an upper bound T(n) on the time complexity of a problem, one needs to show only that there is a particular algorithm with running time at most T(n). However, proving lower bounds is much more difficult, since lower bounds make a statement about all possible algorithms that solve a given problem.

A non-deterministic Turing machine is a deterministic Turing machine with an added feature of non-determinism, which allows a Turing machine to have multiple possible future actions from a given state. One way to view non-determinism is that the Turing machine branches into many possible computational paths at each step, and if it solves the problem in any of these branches, it is said to have solved the problem. Clearly, this model is not meant to be a physically realizable model, it is just a theoretically interesting abstract machine that gives rise to particularly interesting complexity classes.

{"input": "What is a commonly used measurement used to determine the complexity of a computational problem?", "result": "To measure the difficulty of solving a computational problem, one may wish to see how much time the best algorithm requires to solve the problem. However, the running time may, in general, depend on the instance. In particular, larger instances will require more time to solve. Thus the time required to solve a problem (or the space required, or any measure of complexity) is calculated as a function of the size of the instance. This is usually taken to be the size of the input in bits. Complexity theory is interested in how algorithms scale with an increase in the input size.

Thus the class of NP-complete problems contains the most difficult problems in NP, in the sense that they are the ones most likely not to be in P. Because the problem P = NP is not solved, being able to reduce a known NP-complete problem, \u03a02, to another problem, \u03a01, would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for \u03a01. This is because a polynomial-time solution to \u03a01 would yield a polynomial-time solution to \u03a02. Similarly, because all NP problems can be reduced to the set, finding an NP-complete problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that P = NP.", "question_id": "56e1d9fee3433e14004231ce", "passage_id": "3604cb9a-b387-4a82-95c5-8d9bbb0963f7", "answer": "NP", "title": "Computational_complexity_theory"}

In complexity theory, problems that lack polynomial-time solutions are considered to be intractable for more than the smallest inputs. In fact, the Cobham\u2013Edmonds thesis states that only those problems that can be solved in polynomial time can be feasibly computed on some computational device. Problems that are known to be intractable in this sense include those that are EXPTIME-hard. If NP is not the same as P, then the NP-complete problems are also intractable in this sense. To see why exponential-time algorithms might be unusable in practice, consider a program that makes 2n operations before halting. For small n, say 100, and assuming for the sake of example that the computer does 1012 operations each second, the program would run for about 4 \u00d7 1010 years, which is the same order of magnitude as the age of the universe. Even with a much faster computer, the program would only be useful for very small instances and in that sense the intractability of a problem is somewhat independent of technological progress. Nevertheless, a polynomial time algorithm is not always practical. If its running time is, say, n15, it is unreasonable to consider it efficient and it is still useless except on small instances.", "question_id": "56e1fc57e3433e140042322c", "passage_id": "1bffc4e4-addc-44df-92a9-be07af37a2d7", "answer": "intractable problems", "title": "Computational_complexity_theory"}

They were descended from Norse (\"Norman\" comes from \"Norseman\") raiders and pirates from Denmark, Iceland and Norway who, under their leader Rollo, agreed to swear fealty to King Charles III of West Francia. Through generations of assimilation and mixing with the native Frankish and Roman-Gaulish populations, their descendants would gradually merge with the Carolingian-based cultures of West Francia. The distinct cultural and ethnic identity of the Normans emerged initially in the first half of the 10th century, and it continued to evolve over the succeeding centuries.", "question_id": "56ddde6b9a695914005b962a", "passage_id": "7151fb1c-d822-4256-9e9c-7c8f6d19dd00", "answer": "Denmark, Iceland and Norway", "title": "Normans"}
{"input": "What kind of graph is an example of an input used in a decision problem?", "result": "An example of a decision problem is the following. The input is an arbitrary graph. The problem consists in deciding whether the given graph is connected, or not. The formal language associated with this decision problem is then the set of all connected graphs\u2014of course, to obtain a precise definition of this language, one has to decide how graphs are encoded as binary strings.", "question_id": "56e19557e3433e1400422fee", "passage_id": "ada70f84-d17a-4617-a43f-c3ef91022e90", "answer": "arbitrary graph", "title": "Computational_complexity_theory"}
{"input": "What is the concrete choice typically assumed by most complexity-theoretic theorems?", "result": "Even though some proofs of complexity-theoretic theorems regularly assume some concrete choice of input encoding, one tries to keep the discussion abstract enough to be independent of the choice of encoding. This can be achieved by ensuring that different representations can be transformed into each other efficiently.", "question_id": "56e20a27cd28a01900c67c24", "passage_id": "98cbdf13-15e3-4ebb-a455-e24ba7123e06", "answer": "input encoding", "title": "Computational_complexity_theory"}

{"input": "Who killed Harold II? ", "result": "In 1066, Duke William II of Normandy conquered England killing King Harold II at the Battle of Hastings. The invading Normans and their descendants replaced the Anglo-Saxons as the ruling class of England. The nobility of England were part of a single Normans culture and many had lands on both sides of the channel. Early Norman kings of England, as Dukes of Normandy, owed homage to the King of France for their land on the continent. They considered England to be their most important holding (it brought with it the title of King\u2014an important status symbol).", "question_id": "56de16ca4396321400ee25c6", "passage_id": "89c349c3-fb69-4944-8089-7743fef6f105", "answer": "William II", "title": "Normans"}

{"input": "When did Edward return?", "result": "When finally Edward the Confessor returned from his father's refuge in 1041, at the invitation of his half-brother Harthacnut, he brought with him a Norman-educated mind. He also brought many Norman counsellors and fighters, some of whom established an English cavalry force. This concept never really took root, but it is a typical example of the attitudes of Edward. He appointed Robert of Jumi\u00e8ges archbishop of Canterbury and made Ralph the Timid earl of Hereford. He invited his brother-in-law Eustace II, Count of Boulogne to his court in 1051, an event which resulted in the greatest of early conflicts between Saxon and Norman and ultimately resulted in the exile of Earl Godwin of Wessex.", "question_id": "56de1645cffd8e1900b4b5d1", "passage_id": "ab3c1c8d-df5b-4766-8c40-7955e5a482a0", "answer": "1041", "title": "Normans"}
