You will generate a concise, entity-dense summary of an Article. Follow the guidelines below:
Guidelines:
- The summary should be 3-4 sentences long (no more than 60 words) but highly specific, containing highly relevant, unique entities in the Article.
- Do not use overly verbose language and fillers (e.g., "this article discusses") to reach ~60 words.
- The summaries should be highly dense and concise yet self-contained, e.g., easily understood without the Article.
