    "\n",
    "A simulation defines a back-and-forth between a Driver (simulated user) and a Target (the agent under evaluation). Itâ€™s typically used to test how a chatbot or agent performs across multiple turns in a dialog. In this example, we use an OpenAI-based prompt as the Target for simplicity.\n",

    "- Define a `Driver` and `Target` in Okareo\n",

    "\n",
    "The prompts define how the Driver will interact with the Target. A prompt could include some goal that the Driver is trying to accomplish (getting information, making a purchase, etc.), the tone or mannerisms that the Driver should adopt, or information that the Driver should use during the conversation.\n",
