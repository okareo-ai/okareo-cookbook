    "\n",
    "A `MultiTurnDriver` is a tool composed of two language models: a Driver and a Target. A typical use case for a `MultiTurnDriver` is evaluating a chatbot or agent (the Target) over multiple interactions with a user (the Driver).\n",

    "- Define a `MultiTurnDriver` in Okareo\n",

    "\n",
    "The system prompts define how the driver will interact with the Target. A prompt could include some goal that the Driver is trying to accomplish (getting information, making a purchase, etc.), the tone or mannerisms that the Driver should adopt, or information that the Driver should use during the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your Scenario also includes a \"result,\" which can be used to define a directive that we want our Target to adhere to.\n",
