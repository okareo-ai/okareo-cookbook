    "# Running a MultiTurn Evaluation with a Custom Endpoint model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we show you how to use Okareo to simulate and evaluate a conversation against a `CustomEndpointTarget`.\n",
    "\n",
    "An Okareo simulation defines a back-and-forth between a Driver (simulated user) and a Target (the agent under evaluation). Itâ€™s typically used to test how a chatbot or agent performs across multiple turns in a dialog. In this example, we use the `CustomEndpointTarget`, an Okareo construct that let's you run tests against any publicly accessible API endpoint via HTTP requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example is designed to evaluate how well the `CustomEndpointTarget` follows a specific set of directives, and you can use this notebook as a framework for running simulations against your own API-enabled agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸŽ¯ Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "After using this notebook, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Upload a scenario to Okareo\n",
    "- Define a `CustomEndpointTarget` that submits HTTP POST requests against Okareo's example API endpoints\n",
    "- Define a `Target` and `Driver` in Okareo\n",
    "- Evaluate the `CustomEndpointTarget` over multiple back-and-forth interactions"
