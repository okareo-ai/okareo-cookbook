    "### What *is* a Driver prompt?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of the Driver as an improv actor whose *script* is your prompt.  Okareo feeds this script into an LLM and asks it to stay in‚Äëcharacter for multiple turns while pursuing the objectives you set.  The better the script, the more faithfully the Driver will:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Why is a well‚Äëstructured template necessary?\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are extremely capable but also *stochastic*‚Äîwithout clear guard‚Äërails they tend to drift, forget goals, or contradict previous statements.  A rigorously structured prompt gives them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Context** ‚Äì who they are and what they know.\n",
    "2. **Goals** ‚Äì what outcome they‚Äôre trying to achieve this session.\n",
