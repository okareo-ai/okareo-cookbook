    "# Running a Basic Simulation with Okareo\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we show you how to use a `MultiTurnDriver` to simulate and evaluate a conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `MultiTurnDriver` defines a back-and-forth between a Driver (simulated user) and a Target (the agent under evaluation). Itâ€™s typically used to test how a chatbot or agent performs across multiple turns in a dialog. In this example, we will use a simple system prompt for the Target. You can also use our `CustomEndpointTarget` to interact with an Agent you've built with AutoGen, CrewAI, OpenAI, AI-SDK, or any other agent framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example is designed to provide an initial framework for undeerstanding the elements of a simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸŽ¯ Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "After using this notebook, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Upload a scenario to Okareo\n",
    "- Define a `MultiTurnDriver` in Okareo\n",
    "- Define a `Driver` that uses scenario data to follow an objective.\n",
    "- Define a `stop_check` to ensure conversations aren't any longer than they need to be.\n",
    "- Evaluate a conversation over multiple back-and-forth interactions."

    "## Guiding Your Driver\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we'll need to do is create a set of objectives that will guide our Driver's conversation. Each objective is stored as a row in a Scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Driver's behaviors, tone, attitude and approach are defined as part of the `driver_prompt_template`. A Driver template includes the scenario goal. When you are more familiar with Okareo, you can use json as part of the scenario to vary additional Driver conditions on a per-row basis - for example, frustration, tone, or even a product-id. Generally, the fundamental tone and mannerisms that the Driver should adopt during the conversation are part of the `driver_prompt_template`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your Scenario also includes a \"result,\" which we will use to define the expected outcome of the conversation. The `Simulation_Task_Completed` check uses the result to determine when the conversation is over and if it succeeded. You can add as many checks as you need to the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we will see how the Driver and Target negotiate returning shoes that were never used and shoes that are over a year old and well worn. How will it go? You may be surprised."

The conversation \"stop condition\" can be based on tone, beahavior adherence, modal refusal or simply a max number of interactions. "
