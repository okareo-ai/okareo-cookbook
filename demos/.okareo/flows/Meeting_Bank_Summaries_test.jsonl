{"input": "It has been moved in. Second eight comments. Councilwoman Fox. Thank you, Mr. President. This is a bill authorizing the purchase of a building to move the city fleet. And I want to make it clear, I have no problem with the fact that. We are purchasing a new. Building. Nor do I have a problem with the fact that it's this building. What I do have a problem. With is the same problem I had with the 911. Building purchase. The intention. Is. Some time after. This to roll. Both of those amounts into ac0p certificate of participation so that we are. Now incurring more. Debt that the voters have not gotten a chance to weigh in on. And so when we buy things that we cannot pay for and we have to finance through co-pays which bypass the voter, they know that I am help me out. Which I will mention one other thing. I think I brought this up before when the accompanying material comes through and it says, is there any. Controversy surrounding this ordinance? Perfunctory. Somebody just puts no in there. Any time a copy is connected to these purchases, please put. Yes. Thank you, Councilman. Thoughts in the comments on or questions for 1115 Councilwoman Monteiro. Thank you, Mr. President. I see there's someone here from the city who could just give us a little. Well, give us some information, background information on this. Good evening, council members. I'm Jeff Steinberg. I'm the director of the Division of Real Estate. This building is a building that would replace the existing fleet Maintenance and Electronic Engineering Bureau building that's located at 35th and Arkin's Court. This building will be a 50,000 foot building. Currently, it's a 70,000 foot building that's being impacted by an RTD take. The building size will be reduced by 20,000 feet, so the net square footage will be 50,000 feet. Councilwoman Fox is correct in that the form of the acquisition will be financed via a copy. Nick Grimm. And what agency of the city of Denver is it for? It's actually for two agencies. It's for safety and technology services. Okay. So Denver police and sheriff. It is predominantly Denver police. That's fleet maintenance. So that's where all the police vehicles go to have all of the services done to their vehicles. And then separately, the Electronic Engineering Bureau does all the radios for police vehicles. So it's a one stop shop. And is it is it accessible then for those particular city agencies to be able to get there? Because currently where they are, it's pretty easy. Down Brighton Boulevard. Yeah. I mean, this is down Brighton Boulevard as well. This is a 20/131 Street. So from Brighton Boulevard at 31st, if you go west, it's probably less than a half a mile. So it's in the same general facility as the existing facility. And did you do a pretty widespread search for replacement of that property? I spent almost a year and a half to two years looking for a replacement. And ultimately what we were looking for is a site that we could lease. The problem was, is that when we found facilities that had a potential to be leased, the amount of capital improvements that we would have to put in, it was several million dollars. And it didn't make sense for the city to spend that much money in capital improvements on somebody else's building. And whether and what other options for financing did you look at? I mean, we looked at what options there were, which is ultimately the general fund and what moneys are available to be utilized for the acquisition of the building. And there aren't any funds that are available. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilwoman Monteiro. Councilwoman Robb. Thank you, Mr. President. I understand this couldn't go to committee because it came in that week when we weren't having committee meetings. So I think there are a lot of questions and that's why we're doing committee work on the floor where we reimburse by RTD for the building that is part is being taken. Now we're paying less the amount that is being taken. So in other words, the building is currently owned by Belle Haven Realty and in its configuration it currently has 70,000 feet. We went out and had the building appraised based on the architectural plans that show what the building will be after the take occurs. And that's the price that we're paying for the building in the after statement. Okay, I thought so. We're relocating from the. I thought you were saying that the Arkansas court building we were leaving because of an to take. No. This building is being impacted by an RTG. Take the one we're buying. Correct. Okay. So why are we leaving the Arkansas court building again? The the Arkansas court building is a building that will be demoed and be used as a park as the improvements to Brighton Boulevard and the area. Very good. Thank you, Councilwoman Robb. Councilman Brown. Councilwoman Robb asked my question. All right. Thank you. Any other questions or comments on 1115? Thank you, Mr. Steinberg. Seeing none. Madam Secretary, welcome. But no can eat.

To provide funding for various department departments for the fiscal year 22. Increases contained within the collective bargaining agreement between the city of Boston and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. AFL CIO Council 93 have Smith submits a report recommending that the order ought to pass. Thank you. The chair recognizes counsel, board chair of the Committee on City Services, Innovation Technology Council blocking of the floor. Thank you so much, President Flynn. We held a hearing on this docket, these two dockets on April 19th, 2022. And I want to thank President Flynn for joining me at that hearing. As was mentioned in the summary of the docket, this is for me. We've got 1040 employees who are covered by this bargaining unit. It's the second of the many unresolved contracts that are outstanding that have come before the council in this session for council ratification of their funding. It follows the same pattern as the one that we that we approved a couple of weeks ago. So that's, as was mentioned, the 2% raise effective October 2020, the 1.5% October 2021, and then the 2% for October 2022. It also includes a $1,000 lump sum payment for each member related to the fact that the Acme employees across a number of different departments in the city, most of them were really in pretty frontline roles during the pandemic. And so that was an item that came up at the bargaining table. Unlike the Senate contract, it also adds Juneteenth as a recognized holiday within the contract and also adds a couple of wellness days in July in relationship to the vaccine. Moa. The you know, one of the things that we discussed in the committee was just, you know, Councilor Flynn raised the question of why is that? Why is that middle year 1.5 instead of 2%? I mean, partly has to do with the fact that this is the. The contracts that are being settled this year, they kind of have to work with the bargaining reserve that we had for the last year because we're back funding things right from prior fiscal years. And so there's a little bit of a limitation of scope of what was in the bargaining reserve for FY 21 and 22. But again, I think the lump sum payment was part of that conversation. We one of the things we raised was that the council, in sort of the last round of big contract resolutions some time ago now in 2015, expressed the fact that, you know, when we're setting a pattern, we want to make sure that our civilian workers in the city are are seeing their pay increase in ways that are comparable to foreign workers, because that's that's kind of gone out of whack in the last 20 years. So these are civilian this is asking is the biggest civilian union that besides the teachers union that's still outstanding. Um, and, uh, yeah, it was, it was a good, good hearing. I will just say that I know because I heard from them that we have a large number of absentee members who are eager for this to be passed because the way this works for folks who are new is that folks don't get their retroactive pay increase until this is approved and funded by the council. Um, so I know that there are people waiting on those checks and you know, I think it's consistent, like I said, with the pattern that's come before us already and that seems, um, within the fiscal capacity of the city. We had both Jim Williamson, the budget director, and Lou Mediterranee, the special advisor for the mayor, come and join us on the 19th. So. Mr. Chair, my recommendation, um, for these two dockets, again, just operationally, one is for us to actually take the money and draw down the bargaining reserve, which we approved at the last budget cycle . And then the other is to actually appropriate it across these various departments to fund the contract. And so my recommendation, Mr. Chair, is that both docket 0402 and 0403 pass. Thank you. Thank you, Councilor Barker. The Council blocked the chair on the Committee of City Services. Innovation Technology seeks acceptance of the Committee report and passage of Docket 0402.

{"input": "Thank you very much. And we'll be hearing the next item, which is a 1919. Report from Technology and Innovation, Financial Management and Public Works recommendation to amend contract with plenary properties. Long Beach for critical technology needs infrastructure in an amount not to exceed 4.3 million, execute multiple lease purchase agreements and authorize related financing documents with Bank of America citywide. Thank you very much. The motion of the second councilman, Mongo? Yes. If city staff could provide a little bit of detail, I know that officers have received questions and I appreciate staff providing the answers to us. But I think it important to be a part of the public record regarding the use of ACP funds on the media wall and that that funding is not eligible for uses such as street repair, sidewalk repair, any of the other kinds of things that we are always looking for funding for. Sure. Absolutely. Mayor Councilmembers. This is the last breath effort to get us into the city hall and July 4th when we cut the ribbon. So this is the last piece of one time dollars that will need to to wrap up the facility. I'm going to turn it over to our technology innovation director, Lia Erickson, along with Jason Lee and our public. Works directors here as. Well. Craig Beck So whoever can respond to those questions. Council women. Mongo Yes, I'll answer the question regarding the use of the special advertising and promotion funds that that is funded from a portion of our hotel transit occupancy tax, and that is restricted for communications and marketing of the city's facilities and art and public relations projects. It can't be spent on street repairs and other purposes. I also wanted to say that we do have a public art component. This is our public art component, this video high definition media wall. And so this project, this funding with the special advertising promotion funds, goes to fulfill our commitment to our percent for the arts program. Right. Thank you, Councilwoman Vice Mayor Andrews. Oh. But you're okay? Yes. Okay. Katherine Austin. So thank you very much. I was just kind of caught off guard by this and was not a. Made aware that we actually had so much money in our AP fund. And if staff could really explain what the timing of this issue is and the is there some time sensitivity on this particular item? But so we are in the middle of Construction Council member Austin two for the project and we do need to make this commitment to keep on schedule so we can open the building and move in on time. And this particular component, there will be some time to program that that media wall and have it ready for for July four, when the building will open. So that is why this is time sensitive and why we recommend moving forward. At this time. I don't believe that the media war was part of the original plan. Was it or is this something that just just came up as a great idea? Councilmember Austin That's correct. The media law was an enhancement that was added to the building. As we look towards a 21st century city hall, we look to 21st century technology and experiences. And having this media wall is an opportunity to really engage our whole community. I mean, if you think about the opportunities to have a webcam from a playground or a webcam at the beach or to show videos from different neighborhoods and in art displays from different communities, in allowing us to engage with our university, really the opportunities are almost endless when you think about what can actually be displayed on the video wall. Not to mention it becomes a very useful device on those evenings where we have controversial items and we have overflow from the council chambers and we could actually have the council meeting being displayed on the video wall, and that would allow our residents or participants in the council meeting to kind of be engaged through through that wall in the lobby and even into the courtyard of the new Civic Center project. So this is an enhancement, we do believe it's a it's an important element to having a building that really represents where the city will be now and for the next 40 plus years. Well, I appreciate you put it in. I'm sorry I'm putting it into context, as well as talking a little bit about the functionalities of this this wall. And, you know, the irony of this situation that we are talking about building a wall at Long Beach. But that said, I I'm really curious about the the appropriation from the SJP fund because as a member of the Budget Oversight Committee, I was not aware that we actually had this this this extra reserve or these funds available. And so perhaps Miss Erickson can explain to us how that how we're getting this money. Councilmember Austin. I'll put my budget hat back on. Yeah, that's okay. No. Yeah. So we do have if you actually look in the budget book, we do have a description of every fund and the how much funds available is in the fund. And so there was a funds available in the special advertising promotion fund, as I said earlier, because of the restrictions for its use and also the funding source, the transit occupancy tax. We have to make sure we're using it for the proper purposes. And for instance, if we want to make sure it's structurally balanced, so it's actually the funds available is appropriate for one time purposes like this, using money for equipment, but building in use of the structure, the special advertising promotion fund for ongoing budget operations. If their revenue is not there to cover their costs, that would not have been recommended. So it probably didn't come up explicitly in the budget process because there wasn't extra structural revenue per se. But this the surplus was this funds available was shown in the budget book under the this fund. Okay. So I raised that because it seems like you went through too quite a bit to just secure $25,000 out of the S&P fund for for something that there was a lot of haggling to make that happen. And so had I known there was more money available, I think we would have been a little bit more ambitious with funding. You know, one of the the projects that this community lined up, you know, out the door to to support, and that was the the creation of African-American arts and cultural center here in the city. So I'm willing to hear from my colleagues again, this was kind of an unplanned thing. I understand that. You know, it's an element that's going to, you know, make our downtown or city hall look a lot nicer and feel more 21st century. But, you know, the building in itself, I think, accomplishes that without a 60 foot billboard. Thanks. And Councilmember, if I can just add to that, for the African-American Culture Museum. If I remember the discussion, it was less about. The dollar amount and was more about. The finding the right way to use that money. We did 25,000 in general fund. And then just recently in the in the Fy18 adoption, we actually did find a way to use. An additional 25,000 of SRP for that project to get it to a 50,000. So that's been allocated and that's. That's moving forward. Thank you, Councilmember Schubert. I'll defer to Councilwoman Mongo and then I'll speak after her. Councilwoman Mongo? Yes. Just as another point of information, since we do have the art component, this amount was already envisioned to be something art related. And so I think that the choice of what was utilized is really great. I think that it's important when we talk about broadcasting the council meetings on the media while we talk about also that it would be for visitors, that they would also be able to see and experience our meetings as. When I went to Australia, I had the great opportunity to see councilors from the Australian Government conduct business. And so as long as it continues to align, and I appreciate Mr. Modica reminding us about the discussion, because while we would even be able to potentially a lot additional funds, they have to be specific utilizations of those in a meaningful way. The other thing that I would say is, especially since we're so conservative on the Budget Oversight Committee with the public funding, we only try to utilize the funds that are coming in that particular year in the allocation process. It is we have not as a budget oversight committee since I've been on BMC, drawn from funds available ever. We've continued to stockpile that for the upcoming Olympics and other things that we've seen to be a major priority and we have not yet had to dip into it. We actually have been so conservative that this year's the first year that we think we probably expended the entire amount available. And I think that part of the questions coming from the community about CEP funds and how they're available for general fund is that first the funds come in, then they're bifurcated in half. 50% of it goes into available for city uses. And then the other 50% is what's restricted. And this is a great use of those kinds of restricted funds. Additionally, through the budget adjustment earlier tonight and through a item that came from Councilman Gonzales, his office earlier in the year when funding of general fund is moved over. We really appreciate when the Budget Office transforms that money and frees up more general funds. So we think that you guys are doing a great job in that. I mean, I know that's really nerdy accountant talk, but it's what I love to do. And so I just want you to know that I have dug into the numbers and I think that they're doing a great job. And anyone who would like to discuss them at length, I'm happy to grab a cup of coffee and discuss them at any time. Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Schubert. Okay. Now that we had a count and talk and this is a low level conversation at this point, just to reiterate that these are not in general fund dollars. And I know the general fund has now been mentioned multiple times. It hadn't before. So I think we have to make that clear. And also the unique part of this project, as I see it, that that Craig Beck brought up. I can't think of another art project that has a dual purpose of a to an accessory to our council meeting. So thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman Price. I agree. I appreciate the clarification from staff. I have to say I was concerned when I saw the item because we didn't I at least I didn't ask for, nor did I receive a special briefing on this. And when I saw it, I thought, that's a little much. I mean, I don't that's just my personal opinion, like media hopeful. It just seems a little not consistent with at least my vision of what we should be doing as public servants and as a city. I just wanted to make sure that it's not flashy. And so I appreciate hearing from Mr. Beck that we are going to be using this as an extra opportunity for us to show council meetings when we do have overflow. And I have to say, that statement right there completely changed my mind on the whole thing. What I would have a problem with is if we've got, you know, flashy signs promoting all the great work we're all doing that I would not like. That's just not at all. What I want us to be spending money on is promoting ourselves. So thank you. Thank you, Katherine Austin. Okay. You guys have convinced me that this is probably in the best interest of the city to do it, and so I'll support it. But I do. Well, we'd like to just add to Councilmember Price's comments in terms of the use of the board in the wall, in terms of imaging and promotion of of of of elected leaders and things of that nature. I think that we need to establish some some policies and some some some guidelines in terms of what is what kind of content goes there. Because, I mean, if we don't, you know, it can can can get get out of control. So I think that said, I will be supporting this item with the with the understanding. I'm looking at a lot of nodding heads that my colleagues agree that that we may have to look at some parameters. Absolutely. And I and I agree with I think it's been my my interpretation that the wall essentially is like art or you'd have rotating art pieces, creations from the community that it would be kind of a welcoming. Hopefully not advertising. I think nobody wants a bunch of advertising for anything or for events or a bunch of things. But I, I'm assuming that I'm imagining I've seen some of these before. And so I'm thinking that these things are kind of like these permanent art pieces that they can change. They can, you know, they're more it's more of a welcoming thing. And then obviously you can use them, like you said, practically, to ensure that there's information for the public when there is when there's overflow. So I think those are all good. I agree with what everybody said up here. Things are all good. Good comments. And is there a public comment on this? Hi, Mr. Mayor, and congratulations on your upcoming nuptials. And I just want to say I had so many ups and downs in the past few minutes about whether I'm going to get up and speak. This, I think, jumps off of the, I believe, of $7.3 million that also was needed for, I guess, an anticipated critical technology need infrastructure some months ago. And I just hope that wasn't some sort of over overlooked the fact that you guys needed to have technology needs in that building. But anyway, you talk about the advertising and that brings up the thought, if I'm not mistaken, with the way things are going to work, plenary properties is going to be in some major. They're going to be playing some major role in the management of the City Hall Building as a as a piece of infrastructure, infrastructure in itself . And so what I'm not hearing I heard concern about whether there would be, for example, advertising or what type of promotion there might be on this wall, but who's going to control that? And it was going to be plenary controlling that. Then that's one thing. It's going to be you guys controlling that. Then what is the mechanism for you to control that if plenary is in fact the manager of the building? I think it's a good question. Thank you. Thank you. And our final speaker. Hello, Mayor, Vice Mayor Council? Kuzma asked. And there was a great concern that you brought up. $4.3 million. That's a lot of money. We say as far as advertisement is concerned, it kind of seems like it's a contradiction because we have art in the city. We also can see these council meetings by going to Long Beach TV. So I'm a little confused as to why we need a specification. Of a wall. To highlight what we can already pull up. $4.3 million. That's a lot of money. And I think that should be tabled. I think that should be tabled. To be reconsidered, to look at are we doing. The right thing? $4.3 million. I love also what Councilwoman Mongeau said. I thought what Councilwoman Price said as well with regards to, yeah, we may have the extra, but just because we have the extra, how are we spending that? So let's keep that list. Let's keep stand our ground on that. Like, do we really this a need that we need to spend $4.3 million? That's a lot of money. That's a lot of money to say, hey, we want to highlight the meetings and because another country has done it, oh, this is wonderful.

So let's just really table this for a minute. Go back. And just really consider like I said before, Councilman Austin, I was with you when you said, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute. You know, and then when you go back and you do an amendment or to change the original submission, that was like, okay, we're going to do this, but let's add this on because we can kind of pull this revenue some more because now we can justify it. $4.3 million is a lot of money.

Second requires city manager to report back on the cost to expand the summer fund program. And third, explore with the Long Beach Transit the possibility of a special bus or busses dedicated solely to taking people to and from Belmont Pool. Vice Mayor Lowenthal. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I'd like to make a few comments, but would also first like to make a motion to approve this item. Thank you. The Belmont Pool has been a city asset and symbol of our great cities regional aquatic stretch stature for more than 45 years, hosting local, regional and even Olympic competitions. With the closure of the plaza earlier this year, the temporary pool continues. This tradition of supporting community aquatics and the new pool will most assuredly reintroduce Long Beach to the national and international swimming community. However, to reinforce the pool's image, the Belmont Pools image, as a citywide asset that all of our residents feel connected to and proud of, we believe the city should make it easier for our youth to swim at Belmont and every pool, for that matter. As the so-called aquatic capital of America and a city committed to being a healthy community and certainly our brothers keepers, it is in our best interest to encourage our young residents to become lifelong swimmers no matter their economic, cultural or geographic status. And for these reasons, council members, I urge an eye vote from you. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Thank you, Councilwoman Pryce. Thank you, Vice Mayor Lowenthal, for bringing this forward. I have said repeatedly in the Belmont Pool discussions that I started participating in in June and have been very actively involved in until today, that I want the Belmont Pool and of course, any other facility we have in the center but in the city, but especially the Belmont Pool , to be a facility that every child in the city feels is theirs, regardless of it being in the third district, I want every child and family in this city to feel that this pool is their city pool and that they are welcome here and that there is no encumbrance to them being able to use the pool such as a financial one. So I think this is a wonderful item and I encourage my council colleagues to support it as well. Q Councilmember Andrews. Yes, thank you, Mayor. I want to thank our Councilwoman Lowenthal for bringing me in on this also, because as we find out, a lot of in our cities, a lot of times the dollar doesn't sound like a lot. But when you have a family for a dollar an awful lot and I know, you know a Kings Park, we have a problem, you know, just with the kids being able to afford to go to the pool there. So, you know, like I said, I think that this is one of the great things because it provides fun and challenging ways our children stay fit. You know, one is swimming is probably one of the most athletic, you know, challenges that you'll go through. So I always my favorite saying is my kids, they are tired, kid is a good kid. And that will definitely keep them in good shape and keep him out of trouble. Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman Mongo. I want to thank you for bringing forward this motion. I think involving our youth in our community and specifically in swimming at a young age is a great resource for our community. And I support this idea. Thank you.

It's been moved and seconded to pass the bill. Councilmember Mosqueda, you are the sponsor of the bill and we'll hand it over to you to address this particular bill. Thank you, Council President. Thank you. Council colleagues. As you have heard from me over the last week or so, we have worked to put some language together in Council Bill 119783 as a follow up to the legislation that we passed. I'm sorry. As a follow up to legislation. We passed on May 4th, which was Constable 119783. The bill in front of us counts about 119791. Make sure that we move forward on accepting and appropriating federal and state funding related to COVID 19 pandemic crisis in response, including CARES Act funding. This allows for us to allocate the remaining $1.4 million of CDBG funds through this substitute. This allows for us to make sure that the CDBG funds are being spent, ideally on policies that help with densification and redistribution of individuals who are currently in our shelter system. Among a number of other strategies to help make sure that people have appropriate housing and shelter to respond to the COVID crisis. We know that $1.4 million is not a ton of money. Our hope is that this is a down payment on the densification and redistribution efforts to initiate future policy discussions and funding to come from future conversations with the department and the mayor's office so that we can all work towards reducing even further congregate, shelter setting numbers. We know that the congregate shelters are not really considered a safe space, especially given the high risk of individuals in those shelters due to underlying health conditions and their age, which we know is critical for people to have the appropriate public health response. While the 1.4 that we're allocating today to date, that's vacation and redistribution doesn't specifically talk about individual rooms or hotels, I think that this will be a nice complement to future conversations and future investments that we hope to see over the next week or two when we look at additional federal dollars. Again, our hope is that this of 1.4 million, in combination with future dollars from the executive and the CBO that they're evaluating right now, will help us identify additional funds that can be used for frontline homeless service providers. We've talked a lot about mounting costs to support COVID related response, including the need for additional pay for staff, PPE, cleaning food services and other services as we try to serve this very vulnerable population. The good news is that in addition to the funding that we already approved in the last bill, we have learned that $130 million from the Corona Relief Fund can also be used for a comprehensive strategy to meet both the needs for densification and can be used for rental assistance. So it's really important for us to look at the holistic picture as these dollars come forward over the next week and make sure that we're doing both and both rental assistance to prevent folks from falling into homelessness and also to respond to the public health crisis and to move towards additional densification and redistribution strategies. To date, we are aware that there's conversations happening between homeless service providers and departments and the mayor and the mayor's office. So we appreciate that. We look forward to future conversations about the additional staff cleaning food services and housing options. And today, again, while this is not a ton of money, the $1.4 million, I think, does signal our interest in adding additional support to the densification redistribution. Even if we're not directing it towards individual rooms, we have, I think, a joint interest and expressed a shared a shared interest in moving forward on that public health strategy and hoping to have future conversations about this with the next round of funding. Very happy to have learned that the 130 million from the CRF walk run relief fund can also be used for rental assistance. So colleagues, I know that was a question earlier and we will have more opportunities to allocate additional funding as well as efforts around identification and redistribution in our future funds. Thank you all for hopefully your support as we get 1.4 million out the door to quickly deploys as much funding as we possibly can for this critical population. It's not a ton of money, as we talked about, but it will make an important downpayment and signal our interest in future conversations. Thank you so much. I thank you, Councilmember Mesquita, for those remarks. Are there any other comments on the bill? Councilmember Herbold, the floor is yours. You're right. I did. You recognize me? I did. I did recognize you. You broke up this time for me. Sorry. Sorry. I'm your friend. Well, I appreciate it. Thank you so much. I just want to, again, as I did this morning, flag my concern. I'm going to vote in favor of this legislation, although to be very honest, I'm not sure I understand it. We originally signaled by amending the previous bill and taking this money out of of the rent assistance, its use as a way to try to leverage some discussions with the mayor's office to ensure that they would embrace a different model of the intensification of shelters, a model that does not rely on a congregate care model, but instead moves to individual rooms. These are the safest settings for both staff and clients. This legislation does not make that distinction, and I understand why. It's because the executive hasn't embraced this as a priority to support for its specific dis intensification goals. Nevertheless, if without having accomplished that, I'm not sure why we are moving this money away from rental assistance to to address the increased cost of shelter providers for providing service and for their staffing needs. I recognize that there are those increased costs. We have future pieces of legislation that can help fund the increased costs associated with shelter, as well as the increased needs of of rent assistance. Though and I appreciate that Budget Director Noble has proposed a path forward where we can swap some funds in a future piece of legislation. But it just it seems very unnecessary to to do that, given the fact that we could have just. Voted to put the money where it was originally proposed to be put and then subsequently fund the needs associated with the intensification of of shelter and their increased costs. I want to recognize that just in general, I have concerns about putting off rental assistance relief. There were 9000 applications received by United Way of King County over a period of 48 hours, and only 2000 households received assistance. And it's really important. To note that at. United Way of King County is able to provide rental assistance regardless of documentation of immigration status. So it's a very rare source of support for this population. I do recognize that we are going to hopefully be able to make what were the proposed efforts to to fully fund the rental assistance needs in the previous legislation, that there is a commitment to make those whole in a subsequent piece of legislation. But just am puzzled as to why we why we are taking this action, given the fact that there is there is more flexible funds available in in the next week or two to address the shelter needs. So I'm going to provide a customer mosquito sponsor of the bill an opportunity to respond. So councilmember mosquito handed over to you. Thank you. Council President and I want to underscore I share Councilmember Herbold frustration that we have not received confirmation that densification will include individual rooms. Obviously, this is a policy difference of opinion that we have with the executive right now. I will say this, the reason that I think it's important that we are putting forward the legislation and held back the 1.4 is that some leverage has already been accomplished. We know that there has been conversations over the last week and a half that have led to us having some that have led to the executive and the departments having conversations directly with homeless service providers prior to when this bill was originally sent down. There were new conversations that have been reported to us. We had heard from a number of homeless service providers that they had serious concerns about the policies being advanced without sort of checking in to see what the lay of the land was on the ground. Those conversations have happened. You're correct that there is still a policy difference of opinion on individual realms, which I think you and I and the CDC would argue is a good public health strategy. However, I think that when we look at the language in front of us, it does not preclude individual rooms. It offers it as part of the solution. And we know that in conversations with the CBO and others, they are considering an array of ways to do that. I wish that it was all going into individual rooms, but here's I think the reality that we're faced with. We know that there's 130 million from the Corona Relief Fund that we have now identified can also be used for rental assistance, because that wasn't the case when the bill was introduced and there was a real fear that there wouldn't be those flexible dollars to be used for rental assistance in the future. We had a lot of pressure to get all the money out the door for rental assistance. We held back the $1.4 million, though, with the desire for a leverage, but B, to make sure that the folks who are currently in shelters do see some form of de densification or de intensification that could include hotel rooms, but it could also include a number of other strategies that they say that they're working on right now. We know there's about 500 people who are currently in congregate shelters who need densification strategies. I think by putting forward this piece of legislation and continuing to work to amplify our call for individual rooms, and I definitely want to underscore my support for that as a long time proponent of that strategy. Part of the reason that we had gone down this path is to try to urge the 1.4 million to be used for hotel rooms. That is still not a ton of money, but I think putting it forward does signal our interest in that policy discussion, and it also doesn't necessarily hold back the funds that could be used for helping the 500 people that are currently in shelters who need some level of identification. Also, I'll say about the rental assistance and small businesses piece were included in the initial policy that passed. So there was funding that went out. We understand that there's going to be additional funding from the dollars that do come from the executive office here soon. And we'll have the opportunity to ask whether or not that's enough rental assistance or whether it's enough assistance for folks to get out of congregate shelter services in the future. But I think the answer to the why now is we have 1.4 million. We also know that that's a drop in the bucket of what's needed for both rental assistance and for what is needed for the intensification. Since we already put money forward in this last bill for rental assistance and we know now that there's more money coming from the broader relief fund that we can use for rental assistance. My hope was to put the 1.4 million forward to allocate it for an array of D intensification services to really signal our interest to councils, interest in seeing those funds go into place now to help with whomever we can with the 500 individuals who need assistance immediately and that we complement those funds with future dollars. I don't think the you know, the leverage has obviously been a release. I think it's definitely initiated conversations that hadn't happened prior. And I appreciate, I think, our joint interest in both the intensification and rental assistance. This effort, I think, allows for both those policies to move forward in a complementary way. Add to that. Any other comments on the bill, colleagues? Okay. Seen no other comments on the bill. I'm going to go ahead and ask that the clerk please call the roll on the passage of the bill.

{"input": "The Report of the Planning, Land Use and Sustainability Committee Agenda Item 11 Council Bill 118407 relating to land use, zoning and environmental policy. Thank you. Councilmember O'Brien. Thank you. This is what we refer to as the omnibus bill. It comes through the land use committee. Every year, 18 months or so. It's a multiple page document that has a series of clean up pieces of legislation that staff basically accumulates over the course of a year or so. We've had a chance to review this legislation in committee over three different meetings and took public comment on this. At this point, there are three amendments that are on the agenda today to consider. And I want to talk through those in order just to clarify for folks. This omnibus bill is legislation that amends the current law. All three amendments we're talking about today are going to amend the omnibus bill by removing a portion. So these amendments would make the current law stay exactly as it is today. So it's a little confusing because we're amending a bill that amends it to undo it. So the First Amendment, I would like to put forward amendment number one, which I would move and ask for a second. This amendment relates to Wallingford design guidelines. So the omnibus legislation makes changes to the map where Wallingford design design guidelines apply. The Wallingford community had concerns about these changes and had not had a chance to be briefed on it. They raised those concerns in committee. At committee. We asked for an amendment. It wasn't prepared at the last committee meeting, so they brought that after discussion of committee. They brought that amendment to us today. This amendment would remove those map changes so the underlying existing current law would continue to apply. That would give the community time to hear why DPD would like to change that, and those could be considered at a future piece of legislation. I would go ahead and ask for a vote or questions on amendment number one, I guess. Questions or comments on the First Amendment. All in favor of approving amendment number one on the Wallingford design guidelines. Vote I. I oppose vote no. The amendment is adopted. Councilmember Harold, do you want to address amendment number two? Oh, I will. Amendment number two basically asked that Section eight of the omnibus legislation be removed, which would have been consistent then with what the department actually submitted for approval to the committee. Let me give a little background. If you look at the central staff's preparation of the committee discussions, they make it very clear what the purpose of an omnibus bill is. I'll just read from both memos, General. Generally, the omnibus bill corrects typographical errors, corrects cross-references, clarifies existing regulations, and makes other minor amendments identified by DPD in the course of code administration. The Omnibus Omnibus bill is not intended to be a vehicle for addressing significant policy issues. So I think Councilmember Brian and the committee that approved Section eight had some good intentions in mind about how we protect neighborhoods from developers circumventing the system, using what can be called loopholes and that kind of thing. And certainly we are now having discussions where we want to prohibit, discourage and not have that kind of activity. What we do know, though, is in 2016, the HALA Committee will look at design review and the HALA Committee will recommend that the program be streamlined, streamlined to facilitate quicker review. And so, in essence, what I'm asking for is a striking of Section eight, which basically modifies the design review process. I think it's very appropriate had that discussion and Hala actually looks at through the design review process, we may you, I think, fully understand that we will be asking developers, we're going to look for opportunities to streamline the design review process in certain circumstances. So basically what I am suggesting is that we remove this and be consistent with what DPD originally planned. Make sure that in the HALA process that we look closely at the design review process and then make sure we come up with our policy recommendations. And again, I started this by saying the purpose of an omnibus bill are pretty much typographical errors and technical clean ups. And I think we have to have more conversation when we start looking at the design review process. So I think a striking section in it would be appropriate. Do you want to move your amendment? So I move my amendment with strikes, section eight. And I asked Councilmember Brown what he gave me, a courtesy second. Courtesy second. And I'll say everything I just said all over again. So what this basically does is. We're not going to allow that. Okay. All right. We have proposed amendment number two design review in front of us. Councilmember Bagshaw, I. Think you have a question actually. This is going to be addressed to the two of you. And help me understand this. My goal is to make sure that neighborhoods have the opportunity to weigh in when we've got development proposed that are on lots that are close. And I agree with what Councilmember Harrell was saying about having a full review, and I'm all in on that. But my understanding of what Councilmember O'Brien is suggesting is that in the interim, that if develop if there's development planned on two adjoining lots, that Councilmember O'Brien's amendment would require design review in the neighborhood before both are given authority to proceed. That's the direction that I want to vote. So I'd like some clarification between the two of you. I think your understanding is correct. I mean, it's nothing else. I think you have a correct understanding. You know, when I use the term design review, a full design review is about 18 to 20 month and administrative review is 13 or 14. And the streamline reviews 8 to 9 months. And the OHA is going to look at all the review process and come up with strong recommendations. But you are correct that Councilmember Bryant's amendment addresses the situation you talked about. That's a member. O'BRIEN And so thank you, Councilmember Harrell, for bringing this forward. This amendment is an amendment that the committee put in and added to the bill. It wasn't a deputy's request. I think there's always a fair question to ask of what's appropriate for an omnibus bill or not. My intent in bringing this amendment forward, not the amendment we're discussing today, but the one that was already in the bill that's before us was to really honor the intent of the Council in regards to design review and what size projects should be going through that. Councilmember Harrell is correct in saying that there is an ongoing review of the design review process which will likely see recommendations later this year and legislation sometime in 2016. To Councilmember based on his point, my intent with the legislation is it is is that it would go ahead and bring these changes to date recognizing that sometime next year we may modify that when we consider the broader design review package. One just correction. I believe, Councilmember Harrell, that next year this will be taken up probably in the land use committee, not the whole committee. The whole committee will delegate that to the land use committee next year. Any other questions or comments. So we're voting on amendment number two related to design review, which deletes section 23.40 1.00, four point a eight and all in. Sorry. Yeah, I think. I think it's good to discuss this. Oh, I'm sorry. If I could just clarify one thing, Councilmember Gunn. So I will be voting no on this amendment and Councilmember Harrell's amendment to leave the legislation as it was previously amended in committee. Thank you, Councilmember Gordon. I was just going to repeat that, that I would also be voting. You know, it does seem to me that it requires more discussion. It seems to take away a portion of design review. It makes it more difficult for neighborhoods. And I think that this that I would like to vote no on this one. Thank you. Are there any other comments or questions? Councilmember Harrell Yeah, I want to make it crystal clear to that. I think it does warrant more discussion and that's why I am supporting it. And I had a note from central staff that that the holler would be making some rec and a recommendation to pretty much streamline some design review process. I think we all want to protect neighborhoods. I don't think there's any debate, a debate about that. We want to make sure that it's done thoughtful at a time where we're going to try to increase housing. So, again, I don't think it should be put in an omnibus bill. That's really the point. I'm not going to defend the pros and cons of the merits of this legislation. I just think it's a little dangerous to sort of do a one off during an omnibus omnibus legislation. I think that's that's the only point I wanted to make. Thank you. Any other comments or questions? All right. So this is amendment number two to delete Section eight of 23.40 1.00488. All in favor of the amendment vote. I. I. I. I. I. Nice try. All opposed vote. No, no. Sorry Bruce. Seven eight. I didn't I didn't complete. One in favor. Seven opposed. The amendment fails. There's two in. There. Were there. John was also. Oh I'm sorry. Two. Okay. Two in favor, six opposed, same result. All right, amendment number three, Councilmember O'Brien. Thank you. So I will go ahead and move. Amendment number three, relating to citation option. The citation option for noise variance. If I could get a second. Second. All right. So this is an amendment that we did not discuss in committee. So I want to just take a second to explain it in the omnibus legislation as proposed by DPD. Let me say first, the current law for a noise ordinance violation on a construction project gives the APD. The only option is to issue a stop work order. The legislation, as proposed by DPD would allow a separate path where they could also issue a citation. The reason I'm proposing this amendment is concern was raised in public comment over this, and I neglected to actually have a chance to discuss that in the committee. And so, without further discussion, my recommendation at this point would go ahead and remove that language. The DPD had proposed to leave the underlying current law, as is, until there's an opportunity to future time to fully discuss that.", "result": "AN ORDINANCE relating to land use, zoning, and environmental policy; amending Sections 3.58.070, 3.58.090, 23.22.024, 23.24.020, 23.28.030, 23.34.009, 23.40.060, 23.41.004, 23.41.008, 23.41.010, 23.41.012, 23.42.038, 23.44.010, 23.44.014, 23.44.041, 23.44.051, 23.45.504, 23.45.508, 23.45.510, 23.45.512, 23.45.518, 23.45.526, 23.45.529, 23.45.532, 23.45.536, 23.45.570, 23.46.002, 23.47A.004, 23.47A.012, 23.47A.013, 23.47A.014, 23.47A.016, 23.47A.032, 23.47A.039, 23.48.010, 23.49.008, 23.49.010, 23.49.012, 23.49.013, 23.49.041, 23.49.178, 23.49.242, Map 1I in Chapter 23.49, 23.50.020, 23.53.006, 23.53.015, 23.54.015, 23.54.025, 23.54.030, 23.58A.044, 23.66\u00ad.020, 23.67.060, 23.75.140, 23.75.180, 23.76.006, 23.76.012, 23.76.026, 23.76.032, 23.84A.002, 23.84A.008, 23.84A.012, 23.84A.032, 23.84A.038, 23.86.006, 23.86.010, 23.86.012, 23.86.016, 23.88.020, 25.05.164, 25.05.508, 25.05.510, 25.05.610, 25.05.756, 25.05.800, 25.05.920, 25.05.960, 25.06.030, 25.06.050, 25.08.425, 25.08.590, and 25.08.655, and repealing Section 23.40.050 of the Seattle Municipal Code, to correct typographical erro"}

Apologies again to Devin and myself. So this is pretty straightforward, colleagues. It is a request, actually, from the Department of Justice that we update our definition of service animal in the human rights code and in several other codes, so that we are in compliance with ADA and with Washington state law. It now reads so that there are full protections for all service animals rather than just guide dogs and avoids any possible future exclusions for service animals and people with disability. And again, just aligns our definition with federal and state law. And as Jody mentioned, we have a recommendation from the committee unanimously that we pass the bill. Thank you.

Report from Public Works, Parks, Recreation and Marine recommendation to adopt a resolution authorizing the city manager to execute a contract with game time for the purchase of playground equipment for a total contract amount not to exceed 546,000 districts one, four, six and seven. Great. And this is item 38. I know we want to do a short staff report because this is pretty exciting for those councilmembers I know that are getting the the new toy lot so Mr. West Marine Knight. Good evening, Mayor. Members of the city council. Yes, this is an exciting time for us because it's been a while since we've been able to replace so many. But we get tech services to have the presentation and the front, please. Thank you. Perfect. Continue. So the item before you tonight, there are four actually five playgrounds that are receiving measure funding. And the item this evening is for additional playground equipment that was not covered through a grant process for a Drake Park, Los Cerritos Veterans and Whaley. We're excited about these projects because what we are creating with these four parks is actually unique. Destination parks within are playgrounds within our park system. So each one of these four will have a different theme, and we hope that they will attract people from throughout the community to come to the different destination parks. So the plans include put in place rubber, surfacing new sand and play areas, ADA accessibility upgrades and some miscellaneous site furnishings like benches, hydration stations, etc.. So I'll run through the playgrounds. Drake Park Playground is going to be a butterfly garden playground with unique butterfly themed panels, some shade structures that will be in the shape of butterflies , vine climbers, nature benches, flower pedal steps and a log balance beam. So the hope is that children will want to go to the butterfly playground at Los Cerritos Park. It's going to be a treehouse and woodland theme with tree swings. It's going to have a zip line, hillside way of slides and a treehouse motif at Veterans Park. We're excited about this one because it's really more of a challenge obstacle course combined with a playground. So it really encourages children to do fitness while they're playing. They'll be climbing that structures a traverse, a freshwater floating boards and sway steps. So it is play equipment that really challenges kids. And I think it'll be a really exciting element for that park and then it really park. As you know, we have our day camp at Whaley Park, which is our theater and our Music Day camp, and that's very popular. So we thought this would be a great place to have a music themed and science themed play structure with colorful play flowers, twisted climbing nets, xylophones and chimes and hand drums and other musical elements added to the play equipment. And in addition, although tonight's item does not include the Fifth Park that we will be doing to measure a funding is Jackson Park. And so we have a small playground there at Jackson Park, and we'll be able to replace that playground as well with the measure of funding Jackson Park. It's sort. I didn't hear. Oh, sorry, I didn't hear the question. At the end. People were just people asking about the location. Oh, sorry. The timing. Because we did not want to take any of these playgrounds down during the summertime because kids are out of school will be starting in September. So we have up there for our veterans and Whaley. The project timeline, the big award will be in September. Construction will begin in October with a winter completion and draken lo cerritos. Better word will be October construction, November and completion in the winter as well. That is our brief staff report here for any questions. I'm going to have a motion in a second. But to turn to them in a minute, because I just wanted to thank your work on this. These five playgrounds will be probably the best five playgrounds we have in the whole city. And it's a start of of that measure piece that we set aside to redo playgrounds across the city and kids from across the entire city are going to enjoy these, which are going to be spectacular play areas for kids. And so I just want to ensure that we are moving along so that the community can see the results of their of their taxes and ensuring, as construction happens, that we're adequately signing the park so that people know that that their dollars are being put to work on these projects as well. I know that's in the works. As well, so. Thank you for that presentation. Councilmember Superfan. Thank you. And thanks to every night for also providing that timeline. That's the number one question we get. So if you could just reiterate that it makes perfect sense that you didn't want to impact the summer programs, you didn't want construction going on in high use times of the park. So for Whaley, at least, it's a fall project for the construction, as I understand it. That is correct. Okay. Thank you. Fall as in this fall or the next fall? No, this fall. Okay, good. These are going to be next fall for sure. With our partners in Public Works, these are all scheduled to be completed by the end of the year. Okay, that's that's good. Councilman Gonzalez. Yes? I just want to say thank you for these parks. Playgrounds. I think this is fantastic for all of us. And the very first thing, of course, Willmore asked for is when is the playground coming in? So there's this great timeline, and I appreciate the work for both of you. Thank you. Councilman Price. This is fantastic. I love that there's distinct play areas that all the different parks and I think it's going to be great for the city moving forward. Do we have a plan of what the next priorities are for playground equipment replacement? So we have several other playgrounds that are in the queue for replacement. We just received the the housing and neighborhood grant from the state, and that's going to allow us to do two more playgrounds. So we've identified our playgrounds from the perspective of our health and safety needs first. And so we have a playground at Peace Park in the First District that is desperately in need of a redo. And so we're going to be able to do that with a grant. We also have a playground at Martin Luther King Park that will also be accomplished with that grant. And then we are continuing to look for other funding sources. We do not have anything identified in the second year of Measure A, and I don't believe the third year either for any future playgrounds. So we'll be continuing to look for outside grant funding to help us with that. I think that's great. I think that's a really good idea. And we've we've talked a lot about making sure that we have kind of modern facilities throughout the city and modern amenities for all of the residents. So to the extent that we can, even if we need to put up some matching funds, I think that's really important . But of course, the more we can enhance the areas that need it the most, the better. But if we can look at it from a citywide perspective, I think that would be great because I know that in some of the districts we've had some of the playground equipment fall apart and we've kind of, you know, improvised. So there's pieces that don't really belong, but they're, you know, kind of tacked on to a slide and different color and everything. And so that starts to look a little shabby. So if we can try to no reflection at all on Prime, you guys do an amazing job. But if we can start to think about how we can enhance all the playground spaces, that would be great and maybe kind of how how much they're utilized. And and that that might be a factor that we put into the prioritization as well in terms of what park are being most utilized. So thank you. Thank you, Councilman Orson. Yes. This report and item is music to my ears. We've been advocating and working very hard to get new playground equipment at North Cerritos Park and Jackson Park and other parks for some time to councilmember price point. I think once these playgrounds are are put in place, it's going to kind of push the council to have to do more in terms of improving the quality of our playgrounds, throughout in parks, throughout our parks, because these playgrounds are going to set a new standard for play equipment in our city. And so thank you. Look forward to having some world class parks and improvement on what we have. Thank you. Thank you. And I think that it's a good you know, when the council starts discussing additional imagery dollars in the future. I also think I'm a I love putting money to playgrounds. I think that is one of the best uses we could do for emergency funds. And so we should talk about that, I think in the future. Any any public comment on this? Seeing none. Go ahead, members.

{"input": "That's fine. So why don't we go ahead and move to item 28, which is the framework for reconciliation item? Communication from Councilmember Richardson. Councilmember Pearce. Vice Mayor Andrews. Councilman Austin. Recommendation to request city attorney to work with City Manager and Long Beach Office of Equity to draft a resolution that articulates the city's commitment to adopting the framework for reconciliation and Long Beach. Thank you. With that, let me turn this over to Councilmember Rex Richardson. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I wanted to start by just acknowledging this moment and the urgency of this moment. We are facing a crisis. We're facing an emergency. Over the past two weeks, aspects of structural racism have caught the attention of our entire community. It demands change. It demands leadership from our local community. It's a moment that we can't ignore. Much like the rest of the nation, Long Beach is facing a crisis on three sides with the COVID 19 pandemic that disproportionately impacts African-Americans and seniors economic impacts of the pandemic. That really draws into the question into question the fiscal structure and status of all local governments. And then finally, the impacts of systemic racism and the evidence of police brutality across our all across our country. Racial equity needs to be a top priority, fully embraced by the city. As we respond to this pandemic, as respond to civil unrest, the racial inequity in our health and our economy. It's a public health emergency. It's exacerbated by COVID 19 and requiring an immediate response by the highest levels of our city. Now we all witnessed the brutal killing of Mr. George Floyd by four Minneapolis police officers. And all across America, people are protesting an unjust system where evidence demonstrates demonstrates that the system is tilted against black lives, white bodies, and the opportunity for black communities to succeed. This is not political opinion. This is backed backed by science and data and our own eyes which confirm it. There is no way to deny institutional racism. We are having this discussion. Because impacted people have stood up. That's what has brought this conversation to the forefront. This incident in Minneapolis, it's eroded public trust in every institution of government in America. We've all condemned it. We've all acknowledged it. But we need to acknowledge that public trust has been eroded in our own institution and every institution in America. This moment calls the question on every American city, including Long Beach. To restore that trust. That means every city. Let's take a look under our own hood to ensure that the instruments and the laws are in place to identify and eliminate institutional racism. A complete culture change that embraces this as a professional standard, a public health emergency, and ensures that this is essential to our vision of moving forward as a city. And here in Long Beach, we need to meet this moment head on. We need to restore the public's trust, restore the confidence of our community. It means we need to review our own practices across the city. It means that we do not gloss over this moment and that we publicly acknowledge that the efforts are moving forward, are centered on the experiences of impacted black people in our community and our city cannot move forward until we examine our history with race and listen to the voices of the public. Institutions are driven by laws and systems. Those systems are laced with race, gender and the values of those who are in power, who write laws. It means that we take this time to reevaluate our own mission and our own values and our organizational philosophy, to prioritize racial and economic equity and science and data. The five most common social determinants of health are economic stability, education, social and community context, health and health care and the built environment. Studies show that the environments we're born into. But where we learn where we work, where we play and where we live impacts the health and quality of life outcomes. This is very much apparent in America. It is very much apparent in Long Beach, where there is a seven year difference in life expectancy for residents living in East Long Beach neighborhoods compared to those in north west and southwest parts of our city. There is a deep segregation in divide and to narratives within our city. And life expectancy is also disparate across race and ethnic lines in our city. As black black residents are among the lowest rate at 79 years. In comparison in comparison to the citywide average of 83 years. The same socio economic factors are evident in the disproportionate impact of COVID 19 on African-American communities across our country. Cities like Chicago, Washington, DC, Madison, Los Angeles and Long Beach. They show that African-Americans overrepresented in COVID 19 infections and deaths compared to the share of the total population. Long Beach has the same overrepresentation as African-Americans here in our city make up 12% of the city's population and 22% of the city's COVID 19 deaths. We need to commit our system to ending the narrative of the tale of two cities in this moment. We need to acknowledge our own history of racial inequity, not shy away from our history of police brutality and reform and modernize our laws, our policing practices, our policies across the city to align and restore public trust and basic standards of dignity for every resident. Now, when I say institutional racism. I believe that we are one agency. We should have one vision. This is not about calling out any individual. This is about calling out our own institution. So this race crisis that deserves as much attention and resources as the COVID 19 response, we need. We need a high level analysis and decision making. We need a clear reporting structure. We need transparency. We need accountability to the community. And we need a framework that will put the City Council in the position to take action on comprehensive reform, to ensure our own laws and our practices reflect our values of our current city, acknowledges institutional racism, acknowledges our own laws and practices that perpetuate the tale of two cities, two very different Long Beach experiences. It means that we commit publicly to our people to comprehensive reform. That means systems change, placing values of racial equity and public trust into all of our systems, including our charter, including our municipal code, including our city manager departments, including the police department, and including our city budget to make sure it aligns with the standards of the modern American city. Now, tonight, the framework presented is a four step process that requires the city to critically review departmental policies and practices, engage affected communities, and prepare an action plan that will institutionalize racial equity in language. The framework should be data driven so that we can pinpoint disparity and prepare solutions. What are we reconciled folks to say? Why do we call it reconciliation? We can call it what we want to call it, but what we are reconciling is the gap between the experiences of public people, the impacted people, our current policies, and how they stand up against national standards and best practices. We are one agency. We should have one vision to be the best city in America for everyone, not just centered on not just some. And it should be centered on the experiences of our most vulnerable in our community. So the first step outlined is to acknowledge our city. Our own history with racism and commit to a process of doing that. Furthermore, we should acknowledge our own histories of police violence, of systemic inequities, lack of investment into certain communities north central west Long Beach, and commit to reforming those things. Next. We need to listen. What that means is we need to hear the voices that have been protests in our community in a formal way and put it on the record. We need to hear from the experience of affected communities. We need to listen to the stories of impacted residents. These will be difficult stories to listen to, but it's important that our organization listens to the stories of impacted residents. We need to listen to our own employees as well, across every department, including the police department. We need to convene and follow the listening. Following the listening, we need to meet and convene with stakeholders, starting with the black community and impacted people. Our community is not monolithic. Do not cluster all the black community together, but rather give impacted families the space to engage in this process in a meaningful way. If the faith community, the space to engage this discussion in a meaningful way, give the youth an opportunity to in the space to engage in this discussion in meaningful way, need to also engage an independent third party organization to help us facilitate the process of convening, to add and ensure public trust, as well as the process of reviewing our citywide policies and presenting those recommendations. For example, today we received a letter of support from Policy Link, a National Research and Action Institute that advances racial and economic equity, offering their expertize in structuring this process. They help the city with our local My Brother's Keeper process, which resulted in a nationally standard national, nationally recognized local action plan. We have a great relationship with educational institutions. More specifically, we have a strong relationship with Cal State Dominguez Hills, the only CSU founded in direct response to civil unrest in the 1960s. It serves the populations of north and central Long Beach. It's within their mission to address civil rights and racial equity. We should engage them in this process. Finally, the culmination of listening and convening will result in an action plan of immediate, short and long term recommendations for the City Council to enact, such as put us in a position to take action and in that comprehensive reform. This means systems change, placing our values and public trust into all of our systems charter, municipal code, city management departments and our city budget to ensure it aligns with the standards of a modern, equitable American city. Next, we need to recognize the urgency of the moment and take into consideration the timing of our current budget process and the timing to meet the deadline to place a measure on this November's ballot. Now. Now we're not starting from scratch. Let's just start with that. In recent years, and I've particularly paid attention to since I was elected in 2014, we know that there's been a national movement, there's since the death of the death of Trayvon Martin. There's been a national movement that has really thrust cities, including Long Beach, to really talk about racial equity and police reform. And we've taken a number of steps. The equity toolkit, a number of body cameras and other policies are safe. Long Beach Violence Prevention Plan, My Brother's Keeper, our economic inclusion plan. All of that has come from that moment. We have to acknowledge at that moment it took a tragedy of it took a tragedy of the death of Trayvon Martin and then President Obama announcing My Brother's Keeper. And also a pivotal point that we should acknowledge is that is the same moment that the Movement for Black Lives was established. And since then, every indication our city is that we're heading in the right direction. Are police statistics the things that we've doing is heading the right direction. This moment calls for us to accelerate and reform and commit to meaningful policy change, meaningful systems change consistent with this moment, consistent with our values for the future. So tonight, I'm asking my colleagues to support this framework. I'm asking them to commit to the framework, but throw into the kitchen sink the types of things you're you've heard , the types of things you want to see reviewed. We want to make sure we have high level staff ready to receive these things and make sure they're considered into this process. If you have thoughts on what needs to be reformed in our city, throw it into the kitchen sink, throw it all into this kitchen sink. And and immediately following this, we want to be clear, and I encourage my colleagues to echo if echo and let the city manager know that this is a top priority for the city council and that is urgent and should be treated as an emergency. That said, those conclude my comments. I would like to hear from my colleagues on what reforms they like to see within this come out of this framework or what types of things we want to evaluate, what are the things that we want to commit to explore and what types of reforms that our intentions are clear at the very beginning. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Next up is council member Austin. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And first of all, I want to acknowledge Councilmember Rich and his team for putting together a very, very comprehensive item. That I think of the covers most of it. I mean, that's a very good job of doing that. And so so I salute him in his esteem for doing that. I was happy to sign on to go on sponsor of this item. Obviously also want to acknowledge my colleagues, the rest of the city staff for their acknowledgment and understanding of this very pivotal time that we are in. I want to thank you all for your collective commitment to change on Long Beach, but also being a catalyst for change for our entire country. We can show people how it's done. We are a special city. And this also I want to acknowledge those who are taking action today and have been taking action over the last ten or 12 days or so of protesting for change. Outraged by what they have seen. Today we are grieved as a nation of the horrific death of George Floyd. May he rest in peace. Today we began a difficult and we begin a difficult process of preparing for reconciliation, which will frame the pathway to justice, the systemic change. Today, Long Beach has a responsibility to George Floyd, his family, really every black person in this city in America to acknowledge that his life mattered, that all black lives matter. This tragic event has awakened the world to this country's ugly truth. Nation. With white supremacy at its foundation, a nation that is not equal to everyone. A nation with great wealth. Where oppressive black people and poor people are. Nor a nation that is and is fatally flawed. And has fatally flawed systems. Economic systems, health care systems, education systems and policing and in 2020 still do not afford liberty and justice for all. Today in our city, we have a duty to advance equity and opportunity and to create a place where every resident has opportunities and feels respected regardless of their race or socioeconomic status. As a city council, we have a duty to be smarter and more intentional with our decisions. The resource allocation. My responsibility today is to help lead this city through this moment. Then my life experiences perspective, I believe, has prepared me for very well. And I feel like our work presence on this council at this time more purposeful than ever with the work before us. And so I don't take this duty casually in any way because I recognize that this is. Arguably the most impactful work they will do. Together as elected leaders in this city. We've made progress certainly in this city. We have lot to be proud of. But in light of what we are experiencing today, it's put a light sunshine and we still have much work to do to improve conditions for a large percentage of our city. And to the community. I would like to say I'm accepting this charge. I'm prepared to listen and listen more than I speak. I want to learn. I want to act accordingly. My actions on this council do advocacy with our state and federal partners officials, because that is where a lot of change will come as well. We won't be able to breathe it as a city until we deliver and deliver on the promise of liberty and justice for all. So we deliver on the promise of racial equity. And we work to truly. Change the systems that have oppressed so many for so long. And, you know, like I said, this is a a major moment in our city's history. No more wrecks you challenged us to will throw everything at the kitchen sink. And I have an item coming up which I think will be a great first step because we have a civilian oversight process. That I'm not sure that everybody is aware of. I'm not sure that everybody has full confidence in. But that is one area that I want to see us immediately tackle from an administrative standpoint. And then talk about opportunities to to change potentially change the charter in doing so. And so I'm going to reserve my comments for now because I want to hear from my colleagues as well. But I'm fully in support of this item, happy to second it and look forward to the discussion and the progress that we will make together collectively as a city, as a city team, but as a community to really address the ills of the past. Thank you. Thank you. Council Member Vice Mayor Andrews. Yes. Thank you, Mayor. You know, if you were at the city hall today at 9 a.m.. I just want to see Tom. And they said came. It was the beginning of some transformation. Having lived through three rides in the city, the inequities have occurred across the country. I find it very hard to form words. So I'm just going to talk about the issues that bothers me and the things that I fought for in my community every day. I don't really talk on this subject that much. I believe that being on the stage is about opening the doors to the community and the respect we have, the privilege and the honor to be voted in. And I want to share the battle and the challenge. I see because this is a listening tour reunion, the stakeholders coming forward. There are things I would like to see Long Beach do better, and I am committed to doing my part to see the change. I mean, no disrespect to any of my colleagues. If some of these issues seem foreign to you, the kind of issues that affect the success and the community of color and you may have to do not have to deal with them. But I brought up. Against these issues every day. And I drive in my community and sometimes I feel I'm the only one. How is it that the minorities make up the large part? The Refuge Team. I'll get. Okay. And it is a career that gets many people with their record in the door to be part of a city team. How can we do more to bring local and diverse hiring practices for permanent positions with the benefit to the community of corporate? How is it that someone can live in our community but still don't have experience working in certain parts and dealing with that of the community? Yet they continue to accept a supervisor position because they do not have a college degree. How is it that our Workforce Development Department and Youth Workforce Office is one of the most provincial areas of the city? And we started by saying we can't issue people that live in the inner city bus passes to get there. How is it that we have a nonprofit that simply asked to help relocate and do work in partnership with workforce partners? And we cannot come up with additional aid. How is it that we. Yes. Now I'm trying to strive for the African American culture in. How did the city police complaint in Michigan? Does that have an opportunity to have someone who's actually been arrested to serve on it? How? That we can take away community watch programs like Grit. How is it that we do not have a gang unit yet? We continue to see our black and Latinos get. While under arrest in Japan, getting watches on this list. How is the world going to work with our city prosecutor in city attorney office and talk about expanding the level of the playing field and make it a level playing field? How would you say we are going to, you know, incorporate all the commissions like the Civil Service Commission to be involved, the change that we're going to do? Are we going to work with the school district to start these conversations about community and policies? Are we going to diversify our budget so that the rate does not have to do the work? They don't have the current staffing for. I did set up standup outreaches in the Mecca and even go to knock on someone's door because their neighbors has a problem. There was a time when it came out the police would play basketball with former gang members. And because we wanted to we wanted to brag about this because those conversations and get away from this people that you are we grew up that we did not we do not fight this we we did not. But just to go ahead. Why are we having these kind of policemen if we need that in our justice? The policy caused this policy cause we look at My Brother's Keeper and what about my sister's keeper? Let's talk about women and about elevating something like that. I know I've talked a little more than usual, but this is a great item. I want to highlight that even though Rhett and I do not always see eye to eye, our hearts are way in the right place. Just do up by community and not forget where we came from. We are from three different areas, but we are brothers and it is an honor to serve with them on this diocese. And I want to thank everyone for giving me a chance to speak on this island. Thank you very much. Thank you, Vice Mayor. I wanted to make sure. Of course. I don't think it's lost on anyone. Of course that we have three three amazing council members, of course, three members from the black community that have long histories in the city and and a history of leadership. So I want to thank the three of you, Councilman Richardson, Vice Mayor Andrews, Councilmember Austin, for all, of course, coauthoring the item and for the leadership that you guys are all displaying in this crisis and in the past as well. I know we have everyone queued up to speak. Most folks get up to speak. And so I want to before I get to that, I'm going to make some some general comments and then I know we're going to get into more of a discussion. Just let me just begin by saying that they said also last week, I join the the peaceful protesters in expressing my grief, my outrage over the death of George Floyd. This has been a very, very difficult time for not just Long Beach, for our country and for our community. What we're seeing in America's streets is a call for action and demands for justice and racial equity. And there's no question we still have a long way to go to achieve Dr. King's dream of equality for all of racial justice for black Americans. And so it's up to us, I think, first and foremost, to acknowledge that we have a problem. And that's how you begin a fixing are the systemic issues that we have in our institutions by acknowledging that we have a problem. We know that for far too long. And then really every aspect of American life, black Americans have not experienced equal treatment. I mean, this is the case not just in government institutions, which we run, obviously the city, but it's true in our education system, too, and workforce. It's true in in the nonprofit world, black Americans have not experienced equal treatment. This is not that Long Beach is not accepted. Accepted by that. We Long Beach is no exception to that and there are no exceptions to that. We know that the peaceful demonstrations that we've seen are an important part of our local history and the civil rights movement across the country as well. And we also know what is what we're hearing out in the community. It is demands and action is being asked of us as a city. I want to commend this. This concept of a framework for the city. This framework for reconciliation. I think the most important part of this is that it's been obviously put there's a lot of thought that has gone into this framework. I know that the key piece of this, of course, is acknowledging the existence of systemic racism in this country, that we all know that to be true. And the listening piece and I think that is something that I think is really important for us. One thing that I've heard from our black friends, from black organizers and community members is before we get too far ahead of what we think should happen, it's important for us to listen to the community as to what actions need to happen. And so I respect and honor that. And we started that work. And just I just yesterday I was with a variety of young people and youth that were sharing their stories with me. And I want to thank them. And, and those young, young people from the YMCA and the youth that really shared their stories of growing up in Long Beach and their challenges and fears. And I want to uplift that and continue to do that. Listening. And I think what's great about the opportunity to listen is it gives then us an opportunity to really ensure that the entire city is part of that process, including our management team and our staff. And I want to thank I know, Councilman Richardson, you uplifted that and mentioned that, and I support that. In this process. And in the listening piece, of course, you listen to bring people together and then to to have action. And there needs to, of course, be assurances from the community that we are going to have an action plan out of this. And I think that's part of this process. I also want to go back to something that Councilmember Richardson was alluding to, which I think and I think he's right. I think, you know, we we we know that the Long Beach Police Department has come a long way in in reforms. You think about just the last five years there we have every officer that's trained in de-escalation. We know that mental health and racial equity are now trained within the department, and there's a lot more accountability measures in place. This council has been a leader on body worn cameras, and so has our rank and file officers who've been involved in that process. And if you look at issues just around use of force, for example, use of force incidents just last year, I believe, were the lowest they've probably been in many years, and including the use of force, which has declined, but also the officer involved shootings have dramatically declined. And so that tells me that at the rank and that there is progress. And like any organization, when you have progress, you still have more and more to do. All of us, all our institutions have a long way to go to get better and to meet the needs of our community. I want to I wanted to say that and it's important and it's important to note this as this discussion has been going on, that all aspects of American life and our institutions need to be reviewed . It's something that all of us as a city need to listen to and uplift. We know that we are committed as a community to reforms. We want to strengthen them. And I look forward to the conversations in the weeks ahead with the community, with black organizers, with students to address this crisis facing our nation. We will listen. We will dialog, and then we will act. And so I know our community and our country are counting on us. And I look forward to discussion ahead this evening. And so thank you, Councilmember Richardson, for and I'm taking a leadership role in the framework. And to the other members that have put this this agenda item together with the community. So thank you for that. And with that, I want to turn this over to the other members of the council. Next up is council. Councilwoman Pryce. Actually, I think you remember that. Senator Pearce, I know you were an agenda agenda item this week next or did you want to wait? I'd love to be able, sir. I see you. Go ahead also. Okay. Are you sure? I don't mind. I can wait. Yeah. Let me go. I thought I was next so I would go. Go ahead, please. I'll go after you. No problem. Think about the system as that. You never know where you are in the queue. So you only lie on point like. Can I go to the bathroom? No, not yet. Okay. Thank you, guys. Really, I want to ground us in the words that were said before you and I, Mayor and I really appreciate the leadership and the big picture vision that Councilmember Richardson has put in front of us. And that really is process. And anybody that knows me, I always talk about process and how important it is to listen. And so to hear each of the areas of deep concern for our African-American council members, it's really important that we root this conversation and that . And so I want to thank you for that. Of this item. You know, I know it kind of moved fast and so many pieces of it are critical. The acknowledging, which was powerful to hear council council member, powerful to see the work that Tom Modica has done to really make sure that our city employees, possibly for the first time ever, have been told race matters, you matter. And I'm here to listen to you this morning was very powerful to see all of the words and the thoughts, to hear from our own city employees that have said, my brother was arrested. My cousin was this I experienced this oppression. And it really is when we talk about the whole city. It is systematic oppression. When we think back to how this country was started, it was formed. In a way that was built on oppression. Our railroads are built on oppression. A lot of our buildings are built with that. Our roads, our cities, the foundation of them were built on believing that somebody else was less than us. And I, when we ground ourselves in that, I think it gets really emotional because I don't think that anybody on this council or in the city government believes in that model. We all want to believe that we're not racist. We all want to believe that the system is fair because we've had the 13th Amendment, because we've gotten out of what we would call Jim Crow era. But we haven't. And the way that we know that we haven't is in our very own numbers. L.A. County alone. Councilmember Richardson spoke to COVID. So the numbers of COVID in L.A. County alone yesterday were blacks are dying 2 to 1 to whites. 2 to 1. Two to me. In our county. We know that these numbers are real. We know that black women are spending 63% of their income on rent. Can each of you out there listening think about spending 63% of your income on rent and maybe you're a single mom, maybe you have a kid, maybe you have two . What that means for us and why we've been fighting in this city for so long on some of these issues, we know that in the city of Long Beach, we have a life expectancy difference of 17 years. That's from our own city report. Councilmembers Richardson, Austin and Dee mentioned, we know we've got the tools in Long Beach to address these issues, whether it's everyone in, whether it's the Office of Equity, whether it's issues around our housing. My Brother's Keeper. My Sister's Keeper. But it's been it's helped. And I don't want to diminish the work that it's done. But until our entire city says racism exists within our bones, we will not change it. So we realized that in 2014, blacks were arrested four times more than whites. In 2015, we were the most violent. In 2016. One which had a killing rate of 10.6 persons per year. And I agree, Mayor, that this city, from the time that I got on the council to today, I feel like our numbers are probably really great. But telling my community members and my neighbors that our block or my neighbors that have had their kids go through some part of the system, hey, guess what? We're better today without any facts in front of me. It's really hard. And so as we talk about listening, it's taking those stories of our black community with us into every meeting that we take. Even if we think nothing about race in that meeting and I'll lift up health and our climate. We got a lengthy letter today that was authored by SONA. One of our environmental committee members are Sustainable Commission. And she lifts up these numbers about health, the fact that African-Americans don't have the same level of access to health care, that the number one cause of death for many of them are diseases that are caused by poor environmental quality. Like heart disease, like asthma. These are the numbers that tell our story, Long Beach. Our story is not, hey, we're doing better in this one department. Our story has to be that we're doing better for everyone because we know whenever the person that is the most oppressed in the city is doing well, that we're all doing well. We should all all of us in the city of Long Beach be thriving to make sure that the person that is the most oppressed that is on the streets of this city have every access to better health care, housing, education, because we know for them this moment is the moment that's going to matter most for them. So when we talk about what to throw in the kitchen sink? Councilmember Richardson The first thing that we have to do is we have to get data and it has to be transparent. I have said many emails to many people inside City Hall asking for numbers, and I've been told that we were going to get numbers and that we would have a report. Over the last ten years. For. I think in my heart that we have done better in Long Beach PD. But I'm a data person and I don't see those numbers. And so the first, I want to make sure that we are building transparency and trust with our police department. And that's going to take them sharing everything that they can. The numbers of use of force, the demographics of who has been involved in those, both on the officer side and on the public side. We want to know the best practices in the country. What are the best practices in the city that in cities that have made sure that these numbers have gone down so that our police officers can walk down the street proud? Because I'm sure right now this is probably a really tough time for all of them, but it's been a really tough time for our black community for 400 years. And so we're going to have to go through an uncomfortable process, and it has to be genuine. I want us to make sure that we're talking about, as mentioned by also by Councilmember Richardson. The four areas of our city where we can really make structural change. Our budget. There's a lot of words being thrown out there. The first thing I want to say is we need to know what's in our budget. I have personally, I don't have the details of what's in our police budget. And so I don't know what even to say about that. Right. And I know that we've got youth that we've fought to get $200,000 for youth funding for them, which we got, which was great. We've got a youth strategic plan that needs to make sure it has a race lens on it. Right. And that we're talking about how do we how do we make sure that crime doesn't happen in the first place to make an excuse to be able to have more officers than we might need? How do we make sure we're investing on the front end in our health department, in our kids and our job program, and that we're really thinking outside the box. To do that, we need data. And I've said that since I've been on this council. And so I'm very excited about this opportunity to hopefully be really transparent with our city budget. I know this budget year is tough and it's going to be fast. I'm looking forward to our charter conversations, but I understand that charter changes are going to have to wait because we don't have an election coming up that we can put charter changes on. So then I'm really going to ask staff to put everything and every thought into it. Whenever we talk about the muni code, what are we doing on the muni code that we can really make sure we have some community oversight because every city is funded by the taxpayers and the taxpayers are undocumented residents. There are people that come through our city and our tourists, their residents. And I've lived here forever and they're tenants that have lived here. And so what are we making sure that in our muni code that we are creating, if possible, a civilian oversight committee that is free from the city structure that we have. I want to see what that looks like. I want to see the best practices in the whole country for how we can make sure we do that and have real, clear transparency. Because when we have situations like today, people are speaking up that we never thought would speak up. We have commissioners and almost every single commission that the city has, it has said something about how they want the city to be moving forward and we have to listen to them. And Tom, I know that sometimes I get a little mushy with you because hiring you was a big deal to me. It was my what I thought was going to be the last big step that I took as a council member. And one of the biggest things that was an issue for me as a white woman was you being white and being in the city for so long. But I am so proud of the courage and the dedication that you have made to everybody in the city. And when I say that comment, I hope it doesn't trigger anybody, but it's just diversifying. Our leadership is important so that we can have black stories leading the conversation. But we also have to recognize that you are extremely skilled. You're extremely thoughtful. I think you've been great for the city, and I think you're going to be wonderful leading us through this process. So I'm so proud. So those four areas being able to look at them and really talk about them is the most important. We have transparency that we're talking about budget items that we're talking about our use, that we're making sure that our conversation goes outside the city walls and we're talking with educational institutions and business improvement districts. I know one of my birds is so excited about going through this reconciliation process with their own community members. We have to do this not just for George Floyd, but we have to do it for Tyler Woods, for Hector. Or Dante. I'm sorry for Hector. Moran for Dante. Jordan or for Ross. Moran for Noel Aguilera. For Aerial Smith, Vermonters. For Martin. Corrado for Berry. Brock for Jason. I know Gibson for Kerry. Michael found some for Louis Ramirez. For Jordan. Michael Griffin for Katherine Gomez. And for Marcella Byrd. For Frederick Tapp, who was killed by a white supremacist. We owe it to these people to make sure that we root out systematic racism and acknowledge our own racism within ourselves. Thank you, Councilmember Richardson, often, Andy, for bringing this item forward. Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember. I know I've got obviously everyone queued up, so when I get to those, I want to just to clarify something also, I think that I think Councilmember Pearce, you you and I both asked this question on data. And I think just so that you get one of those answers now, I think that the police department is working on. My understanding is, remember, they've done back now, I think about five years. They're trying to go back ten years. So, Mr. Modica, I think that's something from I heard earlier today that the request that's being made by the Council is coming to the council pretty soon. Is that right? Yes, Mr.. Mayor. So we see this and we we hear loud and clear that data is important. We couldn't agree more. There is a lot that we have to share, and that data does take some time to get together. We have started already. We can provide some of the use of force statistics and officer involved shooting statistics. But we do understand and you know, there are some requests from the council, but we're really going to be launching into kind of a review of the data. We're going to be asking our innovation team to help us with that and to actually help display it and make it understandable and transparent and have have that available for this part of the discussion. So we we are going to be making a commitment on that and and providing a lot of those data. Thank you, Mr. Modica. Thank you. And I hope that also answers whatever comes your questions. Let me go to the queue and I know some people are queue to back up, so we'll get to everybody first and then we'll go back around. Councilwoman Price. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Can you hear me? Yes. Okay. I want to thank my colleagues who have brought this item forward, especially my African-American colleagues, because no matter how many experiences we share in common, there are many experiences that we don't share in common because of our backgrounds. They may not ever know the experience of a child who came to America during a revolution in her own country and learned to speak the language with her mother as they made their way in the new world. And I may not ever know the conversations that each of them had at their dinner table with their families and their children that I may not ever have to have with my own children. And I want to thank our city manager, because he did. Right. Send an email that was just so profound and had a few points in it that really I've thought a lot about over the last few days. And that was one of those points. I'm grateful for this opportunity to listen and to learn. And I like what Vice Mayor Andrews shared earlier in his comments, which was acknowledging that we may not always agree or see eye to eye on every issue. But I think having worked with this group of people for six years that I can say whole heartedly with every fiber in my body that every member of this council is a good person and cares about this city. Even if we don't agree on every issue. But this is an opportunity where I think we are all aligned and we all will be focused as we move forward as a city. The events we have seen locally and throughout the nation require that we be on the right side of history and take this moment seriously and focus on the important issues of justice, accountability and fairness. These are issues that should be at the heart of everything that we do. That should always be the case. And it's very tragic that it took the life of George George Floyd to remind us of that important value. We must make significant progress to ensure that our city is at the forefront of responsible and accountable policing, as well as on the focus of residents in the city of Long Beach. Every single one of them knowing that they are protected by our police and can trust in the integrity of our system. Nationally, we have seen the devastating misuse of power by a minneapolis police officer against George Floyd. The impacts of that officer's actions were, of course, devastating and unconscionable for the Floyd family. But the impact has been so much broader. And I can tell you that as a prosecutor of 20 years, that is not the type of justice I signed up for. Like most people in this country, I, too, have been able to reflect on the tragic and violent events that we have all seen, highlighting the need for more action. And as Councilman Richardson said, an opportunity to listen and meaningfully dialog. One of the things I really enjoyed from reading our city manager's email is an ask that he made of the city employees that we have honest dialog without fear of saying the wrong thing or without fear of being judged. I know that his council members. There are times when we have very passionate people inside the council chambers advocating for something that's very important to them and a simple disagreement, even though it might be stated in the most respectable way, respectful way can be misinterpreted as not caring about an issue of the fundamental heart of a discussion that we're having. And I'm hoping that this opportunity is one where we allow one another to speak our minds and be heard and ask questions without judgment. I am saddened, deeply saddened by the police officer related tragedy that resulted in George Floyd's death in Minnesota. I have also spent hours and days and years, decades working with police officers as well as victims and their families. Dedicating my entire career to seeking justice and to ensuring that families who are victims of crimes get closure that they deserve when they are the victim of a gang crime, sexual assault, or a homicide, which are my personal areas of specialty. My life is devoted to the pursuit of justice. And when we see real acts of injustice perpetrated by those meant to serve and protect, it shines a further light on the vast divides we see throughout America today. I think most Americans can understand the frustration and sense of anger felt by many protesters as they pursue this nation's goal of a more perfect union. I cannot support riots, vandalism or burglaries at any level while local small businesses are struggling during this pandemic. But I understand the deep feelings of fatigue and frustration in protesters throughout this country that have not seen the prosperity that's been promised to them in the American dream, and instead may feel a sense of an ongoing injustice. We have recently seen a significant moment in Long Beach develop into a historic movement around the nation to confront real issues and seize on opportunities to improve our existing systems. We have the opportunity to evaluate our current models and make necessary changes for our system to improve. But we have to do that as we also continue to run our city. We do want residents to feel trust and not be fearful of officers. And we cannot allow for a system that protects those, misuse their powers as defined under the laws and the protections of this nation. As the city of Long Beach depends on the trust and faith in our police officers and their commitment to working with the community every day to keep us safe. As a councilmember, I'm committed to help our city every day with justice as my guiding principle. As the Chair of the Public Safety Committee, I will continue to do my part to shine a light on these issues. And in addition to pushing for body worn cameras with my fellow committee members. Councilman Austin and Councilman Super Doll. And before that, Councilwoman Mango and other tools such as public outreach and education and community policing, which have been topics we have discussed. Our committee is committed to looking at best practices and helping our police department continue to adopt best practices. I will say that it's been stated a number of occasions already tonight that our police department has continued to evolve and develop best practices in the six years that I have been here. This is reflected in their current statistics, and in my personal opinion, the improvements in the statistics is a direct result of the investment that we have made in our police department. The commuting, community, policing and transparency measures that we have employed throughout our department has been significant in terms of budget impacts. But those investments have resulted. And better statistics and improvement all around. There is still a lot more to do. We are a community of many races, ethnicities, life experiences and beliefs. But from this varied spectrum, we share one community, we share one city. And people often talk about this term. A Tale of Two Cities. I'll be honest, I don't like that because I think it unnecessarily divides us. We are one city with opportunities and challenges in each area of the city. And areas that we need to help promote, build up and support so that we can continue to be better as a city together. We share a common desire to see our homes safe. Our families protected and representing the needs of everyone, regardless of what part of town they live in. Everyone should expect basic services and protections from their city. Long Beach is a strong community and the peaceful protests we have seen in every corner. Of this. City brings so many residents together to support our city, charting a course towards positive changes in the future. I believe that we are one family. Yes, all nine of us, as well as our mayor on this council. We have served together, many of us, for six years. And I believe that together we can honor the message of needed and prudent and realistic progress. We must act deliberately and with purpose, while bearing in mind that public safety and protection of every resident in this city remains a core responsibility for our city. I want to say that we are going to, as a public safety committee, start this conversation, this listening, this educating and this exploration of best practices adopted throughout this nation. On June 23rd, when we have our public safety meeting. I expect to have a number of proposals that I won't be asking the police department to evaluate and consider in terms of adopting some changes for our own public safety teams. This item read beautifully. Councilman Richardson The item was written beautifully and I appreciated the elephant comments of many of my colleagues. As I shared with Councilwoman Richardson, I do have some questions about some of the specifics of this item. So I'll put it out there, and I'm sure somewhere it'll come back to Councilman Richardson or perhaps the city attorney to weigh in on what exactly are we voting on tonight. Because, for example, when it comes to the ballot measure, I really don't have any idea about what the ballot ballot measure. Well, I don't even really know what the subject matter of it would be. So that was discussed and I missed it. I apologize, but I do want to have a conversation about that because I don't feel comfortable voting on something that I've never seen. And we're going to need to do public outreach and communication. And I know that it was referred to the ballot measure being maybe a placeholder so that we can bring a ballot measure in the future. But I'm not sure from talking with the city attorney whether that's possible without some substance to the item. So with that, I want to thank you, Mr. Mayor, for giving me the opportunity to talk on this topic. I look forward to hearing from my colleagues and a little bit more specificity on what exactly we're voting on tonight. Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman. Next up is council member Ringo. Thank you, Mayor. And everyone is so eloquent tonight in their comments because it's speaking from the heart, just like I was speaking from the heart, just to put a little bit of our historical perspective on things. Of course, remember, again, Vice Mayor Rudy Andrews somewhat brought it up about being involved and having experienced other. Riots, if you want to call that disturbances that we've had in the past. We certainly had hours here in Long Beach this time around, but we also had one in back in 92 of the Rodney King situation. And then when I was a kid growing up in East Los Angeles, there were the Watts riots that that I lived through. So we've all had our experiences. But what I can say about Long Beach is that when we had our disturbances here in 92, there were some positive things that came out of the African-American, Latino, Asian communities came out and work together. We got together to say that, you know, we have issues here in Long Beach we need to work at. We need to do better. We need to improve on it. We can only do it as one community working together. Oh. As a result of that, we had a new police chief at the time, Tony Batts, and that was the beginning of community policing back in those days and that was strong. We also established back in those days of Community Advisory Committee to the Chief of Police and fire and to the city manager, where we had people from the community actually meet with police, with police chief and with the city manager to talk about issues of great concern to our communities. And each one was important and added to that. We're the LGBTQ Advisory Group of Seniors Group and other various stakeholders who also met with the police chief and city manager to determine what is going on and what is it that we need to change in our community to make it better? And we are at a crucial moment now in this point of our history where what's being put at the table today and what we're going to be looking at is an opportunity. And the opportunity is to once again visit a lot of the the changes that we're implementing before and see how we can make them better or improve upon them or at this time, things that we weren't able to add before because we're in a different era now. What I discovered the last couple of well, the last week or so that we've been experiencing all these these. Events is that is different. I know we're in the social media age and what's going on is that this this these protests have been much more peaceful, much more peaceful than we've had in the past. Yes. We've had our moments of of looting and rioting, that sort of. Goes with with everything else but the protests themselves. The protesters in cells were focused and they and they were they were poignant in what they were bringing about and being very attuned to what changes are out there. And we've now come to accept the fact that a lot of the biases and prejudices that we meet, that we're confronted with are systemic. They've been around for a long time and they've come to the surface. I was reminded this morning of our issue that I marched on and protested back in 1996, which was a proposition to name the anti-Affirmative Action Program. Our proposal for Proposition eight was put forward by then Governor Pete Wilson. I marched against that. I fought against it. And I wanted to I wanted to get it down because I knew it was wrong. And what they tried to do was basically saying that affirmative action programs were were illegal and did not serve any purpose. And and getting rid of those kinds of programs would level the playing field. Well, what have we learned in the 26 years between then and now that the level of the playing field is still not level ? In fact, it is even more a level now than it was even then. And there's an effort now with another bill that's being is which is legislature is to repeal to only because it's still on the books. And that's part of the systemic issues that we're dealing with, is that there are still items on the books that are counterproductive to where we need to be, to where we need to get. So I'm saying that in providing the historical perspective in the sense that we still have a lot of growing to do, we still have systemic bills and pieces of the legislature that are in need, dire need of change and repeal and new ones to go forward. And this is our opportunity to do such. I know Councilwoman Pryce mentioned that it was very unclear as to what specifically we might be looking at. But that's I think that's the whole point, is that we need to have that discussion. We need to look at what we're going to do in the future to make us better, to make the city a lot stronger. We need we are a strong city and I believe in this. I love this town. I'm not going anywhere. I love every aspect of my community that I've been here, been able to build lifelong friendships since I came to Long Beach as a freshman and Long Beach State and made many of them. And like I say, one of the other one of the other things that we want to look at and it wasn't institutionalized then, but perhaps this is an opportunity we can do that now, is to institutionalize these advisory committees or advisory groups that we're looking at, because they seem to come and go with whoever is on the sits on the chief's chair or whoever sits on the city manager's chair. And they and they and they ebb and flow with something that's more permanent or stable so that these discussions are ongoing from here on out, that we don't have to have these types of services and nobody and nobody has to die in order to bring this to the forefront. We say their names. And Janine, thank you for mentioning seeing all those names because they're a part of our history. And as sad as it makes me feel and at times angry, to want to go out and do something about it. But we have to do it with logic. We have to do it with data. We have to do it in a way that's such that we is going to be effective. And I have been as an example of great proponent of institutionalizing our health department, for one. But we also need to look at institutionalizing these types of committees as well, these types of groups that would be provide a voice and a venue for people to come forward and voice your concerns. And it has the city council or manager or the police chief move on them. So it's this is a beginning. I see this as a start. And it's and it's also, at the same time, a continuation of where we've been before and what we need to get. So please look at this as a as a way of. Growing as a way of learning and as a way to also. Go again. To get to a place where we need to be. With that, I guess some. Done here. And if I if I had to come back and say something more might come back to me, I don't know. But at the same time is let's work together. And one of the most proudest moments that I've had thus far is that we have, if not the most, one of the most diverse city councils around. Basically unique. You name a. A community and is represented in our city council. We have immigrants, sons of immigrants, daughters of immigrants, African-Americans and LGBTQ. We're all represented here. And we are we ourselves are a reflection of our community. And that's what makes us strong. And that's what's going to keep us strong as long as we keep that focus that we know we have a large community here where half a million people, you're probably grown a little bit more. And it's going to be again for the people out there who are listening. Important to fill out the census. It's going to be important for us as a city where we apply for these grants and we apply for federal funds that we need to. To move forward with with. With getting getting the sense is that we account for our son. So with that, I'll leave it. I'll leave it there. I'm sure there's going to be more discussion. And as we move forward with this, we decided we're going to be having a lot more a lot more discussions. And hopefully when we continue these discussions, there'll be we'll be in a better place than we were last week. Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember. Next up is Councilman and Diaz. You. May I? Thank you very much. First and foremost, I like every American. In the past weeks, I've been absolutely devastated to see another video of an armed, unarmed black person being killed by a officer who is sworn to protect their community. This is just one of the small pieces of our country's long and violent history of systemic racism and white supremacy, a legacy that continues today to impact every aspect of our society. The revelation so many people have experienced over the past few days. I think the black community has known and organized the girls for decades, and I think that it's important that we recognize that some of these steps are going or some of the steps were taken right now are long overdue. I'm so heartened to see the parts of the items that request concrete action in the face of racism and injustice, as we have seen in our streets and around the country. It's not only time to acknowledge the problem, but also to implement solutions. I look forward to working with my colleagues and staff to create reform in our city from the way we are governing to the way we are policing, to the way we allocate resources to our community. I am proud to stand with each of you in this first step, but I know that there are many more steps to come and eager to get started. I want to absolutely thank our my council colleagues, council members Richardson, Austin and Andrews for Vice Mayor Andrews for bringing this item forward and also for their their contribution to our city as African American from the black community. I think it's very important that we see. Them as role models for other generations, them that were elected into these positions and and are able to make certain changes within our city. This is what we need. And I'm very proud to serve on a very diverse city council. And I, like it's been said by my colleagues before me at times that we may not see eye to eye with each other. But I do believe in from the bottom of my heart that today we stand here before you all in agreeance that something needs to be done. And I'm I'm very, very proud to be on the city council. Thank you. Thank you, councilman and de haas councilmember supernova. Thank you. And I'd like to first thank those who brought this item forward. And I'd also like to thank Councilman Richardson, Councilman Austin and Vice Mayor Andrews for their eloquent and heartfelt remarks. I think they serve as a perfect opening to this discussion. I'm like Vice Mayor Druse and Councilman, you rank. This, too, is my third episode of Civil Unrest involving Long Beach. Um, and I can say that this. The aftermath of this feels very different to me. Uh, Councilman Franco referenced social media. Perhaps that's it. But this is the first time I. See this broad. Recognition of systematic. Racism. And obviously. The killing of George Floyd has served as a catalyst to bring us to this moment. Um, I think we have, um, we should be very hopeful. And again, I don't mean to sound repetitious, but maybe it's because we've lived through it. Councilman here. You were going to mention how there were many changes made after 92. And I'll go back to 1965 and the Watts riots. And, um, in the aftermath of that civil unrest, money flowed to Los Angeles. Federal dollars flowed in Sacramento. Dollars flowed in. I'm not sure how many of those dollars made it to what. But I think we can improve upon that. Now, as Councilman Frank said, so many improvements after 92. And maybe this is it. Maybe this is the time where we see everything, the discussions happen, the plans in place. And as I referenced, we just need systems in place on an ongoing basis to make sure that the changes we enact are sustainable. I don't think it is. Just from my background, I know the coffee of the the chair of the Sustainable City Commission was mentioned. Having served on that commission for seven years and also served as chair, I think the topic that was brought up generally is environmental justice. So to concentrate just on the things that we're going to throw in the mix here. Not that that's the only thing, but I feel an obligation to bring that forward. With my background also, I currently serve on the Public Safety Committee and we will be working on that. As well as Chair Price. Mentioned on the 23rd. So those are some of the things we'll be bringing forward. For those of you who don't hear me, normally my my signature is brevity. I just didn't want anyone to think that because of my style, that reflects at all on on my position on that. I choose. This is one of the. Critical moments for our council. One of the most important things that has ever come before us, and I look forward to helping shape these changes for the future. Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember. Councilwoman Mongo. Thank you. I want to start by thanking both Mary Andrews, Councilman Austin and Councilman Richardson for your continued leadership in our city. I appreciate the heartfelt comments of all my colleagues. So much has already been said and I won't repeat what has been said. But I will say that over the last few weeks I continue to listen. I believe that true wisdom comes from listening and that we as a council need to continue to keep listening at the forefront of the policies that we will work towards and develop over the next several months. The only thing that I have to add is in reading the items and in listening to what? Government agencies and community partners are doing across the country. I see some significant value in coordination and I think that institutionalizing that coordination would be imperative. We can't do it without our partners. And so if there was a way to ensure that we. As we work through this process, make presentations to our partners, the school boards, the trustees, and for them to make presentations to us on where they're headed so that we can ensure that where our agencies progress crosses, that we institutionalize the solutions across all of the groups together so that the investment goes the farthest by ensuring it. That we build on each other and their successes and the listening. So with that, I want to thank everyone for their peaceful demonstrations over the last several days. And. I think that it is poignant that our city is on the forefront of this as we have been on so many things. And it would not be possible without the community leaders that have supported this and so many other equity and equality issues. Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman. Next up, I have I'm going to go back to I think everyone has. Has made their comments. Let me go back to Councilmember Pearce. Thanks. Mayor, I wanted to just I realize that I left out a part that I wanted to talk about as far as the city's thinking about process. And when we acknowledge structural racism, we acknowledge that so often the black community has not felt like spaces were safe for them, that they were not safe for them to speak up, that they're not safe for them to participate in. And I reflect back to the land use element and what those spaces were like and also what those spaces were like for our African-American staff. And so I am not sure that Thomas spent a lot of time thinking about what the process will look like in dealing with this this health emergency. But it is so important that black voices are heard. I would say first that if organizations, even if they seem like organizations that the city has never worked for before, like Black Lives Matter or anybody else says, Hey, City, we're ready. We're ready to talk and we want to listen that we go to them and that we make sure we engage them in a space that is safe and that they can and work in and that we do that with our youth. I appreciate that you visited our youth yesterday, but really recognizing that for so many this the city isn't the same across the whole city and that we really have to get ourselves out of our comfort zone to hear these these black voices so that we can, you know, change where where we put our priorities. And we do that with our resources. And that includes city staff time and how we function as a city. So really wanting to make sure that the black community that is diverse is the one leading on this reconciliation. Otherwise we will not have the trust of our diverse black community and all of this will be just a process. So that's my thoughts. Thanks, guys. Thank you. Councilman Richardson. Sorry. It's muted. Okay. So I want to take a minute and just so earlier, I needed to kind of just make sure that I presented the framework correctly. And now I want to just take this opportunity to kind of refocus on what we're trying to do here. So so one, the reason we put acknowledgment out there first is because what we do and what we say from this moment forward, we can either acknowledge or we cannot acknowledge. And we have to be a model and be an example of how we do that. So we yes, we are one city and name, but the reality is our systems perpetuate two realities and two different commitments from our city to a race. That experience is not the way to start this process. Ignoring that point means we're not grappling with real issues, which is what this moment demands and is what Long Beach is clearly demanding. We need to focus on inequities in order to bring equity. If we are truly one city and we and we do not want to be divided. Then we have to look at the disparities and data that divide us and put in strategies to close gaps and bring us closer together. So yes, we are one city, but this conversation is not about that. This conversation is about the differences so that we can truly be one city. Secondly, in terms of acknowledging history, I think it's important to acknowledge on the front end that we haven't even in the last last five years, we haven't truly acknowledged this stuff. You know, we're a city that like, it's okay to acknowledge our history and acknowledge that the KKK marched down Ocean Boulevard and Long Beach three years ago. We commissioned a report on economic equity in Long Beach. I commissioned this report. It acknowledged that history, that language was removed from the report by our city staff. That simple action in and of itself is an example of institutional racism. Therefore, it needs to be called out in that process so that in this process there is integrity. I want to say that as professionals, we should not be neutral on certain things. Embracing racial equity should be a professional standard, just like acknowledging sexual harassment is a passive professional standard. That standard has evolved over time. Acknowledging sexual harassment in the nineties 1870s looks different than it looks today with MeToo and Time's Up. This is one of those moments we need to, as professionals, acknowledge that we cannot advance in our organization. You cannot be advancing your career. We can't advance moving forward from this moment without mastering it. And mastering it takes training and acknowledgment. Acknowledge that institutional racism needs to be named and called out. This is our chance as leaders to change the direction structurally and meaningfully. Also, we should acknowledge that we have. Due to COVID 19, we haven't been able to take public comment. There are people and voices that want to be heard right now. So we are I know we are taking steps to get back open, but it is important that this listening process is public and on the record. It was mentioned earlier the land use element, when there were a lot of anger around the land use element, the city stepped forward. The city put up tents and listened to people and let them vent. And that process in and of itself was stand up. And that process had its own integrity. Separate from the speeches that we give as politicians. The staff owned that process and they listened and they created the work plan from that. Next, we need to clarify the integrity of this process. There are a lot of separate process taking on and off the state legislatures doing things. I know the federal government is doing things and we are going to watch and track all of those efforts. And that means sometimes our committees, state ledge, fat ledge, public safety committee, all of those have individual committee work directed by individuals, directed by committee members and elected officials. And those are important and they are relevant to the discussion. But it's important to note that the framework in this motion is directing city staff to have a process separately from all the other processes that are happening. And that process needs to maintain its integrity all the way through and be centered on input from the public listening process on the record and the convening process that is important to clarify next. I think just, you know, this is a moment where we are redefining what resiliency means is no longer just about preparing for an earthquake. When I walk through Artesia Boulevard, if I look down on Pine Avenue, I see businesses closed due to a pandemic . When I walk down pineapple today and see board businesses boarded up and murals on there, it tells me that this is is a public health issue, that public health and racial equity, if not addressed, can be as dangerous to our community as an earthquake. So this is a moment for us to redefine and be an example for our region on how to redefine resiliency and prioritize. Public health, economic inclusion and racial equity is a process that we're setting forward today. It's about translating the voices, the demands of the protests in our community into a strategy for local action. And that's why public comment on the record is important, that we capture this moment in our city's history, that we acknowledge this moment, we acknowledge our past, and we move forward together. That is incredibly important in this process. Thank you. The last thing I want to say is I want it reflected in this motion. I want it reflected in this motion that this is the city council making a statement that this is considered a public health emergency. Thank you. Thank you. I'm Tom Richardson, and thank you to the entire council for the comments. And it certainly is a a public health emergency. With that, we've concluded our council comments. We have, of course, some other items that are related. And so if I can, please go ahead and get a roll call. Actually, Councilman Price. So I just want some clarification either from Councilman Richardson or or the city attorney in regards to the ballot measure. Are we voting? Is there anything we're doing tonight in regards to a ballot measure? I can clarify intent, if that's okay. Sure. Perfect. Okay. So, as I mentioned in my comments, all of this should be able to land in systems change. And system change to me is defined as changes to charter, changes to the municipal code, changes to city manager pilot policies as well as budget. All of those are the systems in which guide our government. And so whatever recommendations may come out of that, the instruments to train, change, those all have different requirements, for example, charter change. So we know that the PCC requires a change to the charter. If you want to eliminate it, if you want to reform it, it requires those things. And so they would have to be preparation for an election if if that is something the city council chooses to do separately. We know that there are certain things, some things that require changes to the municipal code by ballot. For example, some of our cannabis laws, you know, we don't have a reputation of having a cannabis equity law that is as progressive as it should be due to the limitations placed on us by the voters and how they did that. That is one example of something we can place on to truly ensure that of the cannabis businesses reinvesting in communities have been impacted by that industry for many, many years. Those are the types of things, types of strategies that may come out of this process, looking at reinvestment of cannabis equity and and looking at barriers in our system that stop that from happening. And so this motion says, look what the city council in a position based on whatever comes out of this process to take action, don't let the deadlines of ballot measures and all of those things. Don't let this process stop any of those opportunities for reform. And so we know we have two immediate opportunities in front of us. One is our budget. Two is the upcoming election. And we also know that some things we can just enact outright as a city council, we have the power in some ways to do that. So that's the the reason I mentioned ballot measure, because that may be a requirement in order to change some systems. Okay, I get it. That seems pretty clear to me and I thank you for clarifying that. So we're going to do this listening process. We're going to engage in meetings and we're going to talk. And if there are some best practices that we think we want to employ, then we might propose some specific ballot measure, but we don't know yet what that's going to look like. We don't know what to make of it. We don't think that's going to be of the process. True. Got it. Okay. Thanks. Councilmember Pearce. Thanks, Mayor. I wanted to just reflect, Councilmember Richardson, when you asked that your motion be clear that this is a health priority in crisis, that there's also the resolution attached. And I'm not sure when that's going to come back, but I think that it was included in there. But more importantly, my my question is for staff, there's one piece, you know. Councilmember Supernormal mentioned it. I mentioned it. The health inequities around our environmental piece, the city has done an excellent job of preparing our plan. It has sat on a shelf now for a year. I know part of that debate because the cap basically says that in order to reach our environmental goals, we have to have a CPA in place. And so it's it's been sitting there for a little bit. When is the timeline coming back on the two from four on the CAP plan? Because it has a you know, it directly impacts our black community and communities of color. A question for Tom on the Climate Adaptation Action Plan. Yeah, looking to see if Linda Tatum, she was here just a second ago. Linda, there's a question about the cap plan and when that might be coming back. So Linda Tatum will answer that question. All right. We are preparing a24 from. That'll go out. It'll be sent up to the city manager's office. I have a draft now. We're looking to get that out either this week or next week. And in that, it will outline the the remaining schedule to complete the cap and bring it back to the city council. Great. Thanks. Didn't want to get us too far off topic, but just recognizing that we have some tools and toolbox. Thank you guys. Very excited to take this vote. Thank you. Councilmember Pearce, before we go to a vote, I know that the the city attorney, I think had a had a clarification. I think I know the answer. I know that as far as the city attorney think, you're you're you're you're wondering about the the declaration of emergency. And I understand that that's not a formal action that the council can take tonight. But I think that Councilman Richardson, correct me if I'm wrong, is talking about this in general terms, that that's what the moment that we're in. Is that correct? Councilman Richardson. Yeah. There's a few things. One, it mentions the priority and urgency of the moment. Two, we're already in a COVID 19 pandemic. We know that we're operating under a state of emergency. We have we're connecting based on data. We know it has a disproportionately disproportionate impact on from the health standpoint in African-Americans, as well as the economic fallout is disproportionately impacting African-Americans and many, many people. So there is a direct connection to the emergency we have. Those are important in local government to declare and to and to define. So that's what we're doing. So we're not saying declare a new emergency, to be clear. This is directly connected to the emergency you're in and it should be received with the same level of urgency. That is my point. Yeah, I hope that I hope that I'm interested in turning to that. Clarify it for you. I believe so. I think that the way I understand the motion is it is not an actual declaration of a health emergency. The council member is saying it could be and some of these actions taken could help assist in the current emergency. But those emergencies have to be declared by the health officer. And so if if the health officer makes that declaration, then it would come back to council for approval of that declaration. So there's not a formal process that would come back to you unless the health officer declares it a formal emergency. So as I understand it, the motion tonight are your four items, and there's definitely several items that will be coming back to the council as staff progresses through these phases of the resolution articulating it. The public statement, I think, has already been made the formal listening and then convening the stakeholders and out of that then there'll be items maybe separately or all at once, depending on how the city manager does it comes back to you for further action. And this is time just to add to that. I think that's right. The way I'm understanding the sense of the council and the motion is you want us to consider this to be one of our absolute top priorities that we were working on that was loud and clear today. We are committed. We're ready. I do want to point out that that comes with a price. When we put this ahead, we put other things behind. And so we are going to be taking that action. We will move things around. We will treat this with urgency. You're asking a lot in this motion. I think it's very good. I think it gives us some good structure. And it's an it is a very aggressive timeline. So we will be putting together structures to to treat it with the importance with which you have all spoken so eloquently tonight. And it is our job then to let you know what the other things that we will have to manage around and we will ask for the council's patients on that as we prioritize really this our COVID response and our budget, those are our three main things. And I think the point that Councilmember Richardson was making is that there are shared themes in all three of those that can be interwoven together, and we will be looking for those. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Modica. And then as we as we turn to the vote, I would also add this is something that Councilmember Richardson and I have talked about, and I and I agree, and I think we've mentioned this as well. Mr. Murdoch, I think as you begin to put together this plan, and I think you've acknowledged the importance and the urgency of the plan by the Council, we have incredible talent in this organization. We have incredible our rank and file employees in every single department in the city and managers and leaders that that love this community, that are part of this community and that and feel the same pain that we talked about tonight. We have a members in our public works crews. We have librarians. We have firefighters. We have all types of employees that really can help lead on this issue. I'm thinking about our our black or black employees or black managers that really have, I think, a unique perspective. So as we move forward in this process and we move forward to to really put together this framework. I'm also hopeful that we can tap into their immense talent and commitment to our city, because they're going to have a very unique perspective on the work ahead of us. And so I thank you, Mr. City Manager and the council and to Councilmember Richardson kind of for spearheading this and certainly to Vice Mayor de Andrews, to Councilmember Al Austin for your leadership and Councilmember Pierce for helping also in the coauthoring this item. We know this was a lot of work and we look forward to getting to work after that. After listening. So thank you all. And with that, we're now going to have the clerk do the roll call vote, please. District one. I district to district three. I strict for. I District. Five. I. District six. By District seven. I. District eight. All right. District nine. District nine. I got some a record. This thing is muted. Sorry, I. Okay. Great. Thank you. Much information carries you counsel. We do have a couple of items are still a part of this broader discussion. And thank you all for that conversation on the on the general framework. So now we're going to take up item 26.", "result": "Recommendation to request City Attorney to work with City Manager and Long Beach Office of Equity to draft a resolution that articulates the City's commitment to adopting the \"Framework for Reconciliation in Long Beach,\u201d recognizing the need to engage in a public reconciliation process, internal policy review, and local action plan committing to the following four steps: Request City Manager to issue a public statement condemning the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, MN, acknowledging the existence and longstanding impacts of systemic racism in our America and in Long Beach; Request City Manager to conduct a formal listening process to hear accounts and experiences of racial injustice, inequity, or harm of community members; Request City Manager to convene stakeholders to evaluate the feedback from the listening process and shape policy, budgetary, charter, and programmatic reform ideas; and Request City Manager catalyze action, presenting immediate, short-term, medium-term, and long-term present recommendations for the City Council to consider."}
{"input": "Believe it or not, this is going to be the longest meeting we ever had. So next up is 22. Real quickly, Madam Clerk. 23. I'm sorry, 23. Item 23 is communication from Councilwoman Price, Councilman Andrews and Councilman Austin. Recommendation to request the city manager to prepare a report on the specific areas relating to homelessness and residential quality of life in the city of Long Beach. Thank you. Exit quietly, please. That'd be great. Thank you very much. Councilman Price. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I want to thank we had about five residents here earlier, but they had to leave to put kids to sleep. And we have one resident who stayed behind. So so thank you and bless you for staying. This item comes as a result of constituent feedback and information that we have received and of course, the great work that the city has done in regards to homelessness. I know this item is long, but I want to talk through just a few things. Long Beach has been making major strides towards addressing homelessness. City staff has made us one of the leaders in the state and how we help the homeless. I want to specifically thank two three of my colleagues who have had an important role in this issue. Councilmember Pearce, with her support of the Hart team, Vice Mayor Richardson with his work on affordable housing. And Councilwoman Gonzalez with her request for data collection, which is very vital to this process. I hope that we as a city can build on this important progress and continue to be a leader in addressing homelessness. This specific item seeks to collect more information that would be useful in actually developing strategies for a long term, multi departmental city approach to homelessness. I've indicated a number of areas in the items, but I'm truly open to any additional ideas from my colleagues on the departments and the departments themselves on ways that we can better address the needs being felt around homelessness and residential quality of life issues. Generally, the spirit of this item is to see how we can expand things that are successful and fill in gaps in addressing areas where we have opportunities. I encourage our city manager to use his judgment and the resources available to him and instructing the various departments that could have an impact on homeless issues. Oftentimes, we think of homeless issues as impacting only the health department or the police department, but that is simply not accurate. The listed bullet points in this item are meant to spur ideas that can get us closer to a long term multi departmental approach to homelessness in the city of Long Beach. Further, with Measure H money coming in, as well as so many of the great progress and successes and stories that we have about homelessness and our individual successes in our districts, how we can help expand our services to be more efficient and effective using Measure H resources and opportunities will be vital. There are so many different approaches that we can take to make an impact on homelessness and with various city departments having unique abilities to have different effects on this problem. This item is meant to establish a multi departmental focus and a holistic approach to homelessness and residential quality of life issues. Homelessness also affects many residents. For more information, with many departments, we can better help those who are suffering from homelessness, as well as residential and business communities impacted by the issues around homelessness. I'm open to suggestions from my colleagues, but I do want to say that this item came about for us because it's something that we've been working on and we've been paying attention to what my colleagues have been doing on this council. And although I know that reports have come back, I know there was some mention that, you know, we've already done some of this work or maybe it's duplicative. You know, looking at, for example, the March 9th report that came back on this issue. You know, there's a lot of good programs and ideas that are that are referenced, but there's really not a lot of details in terms of how we're going to accomplish some of our goals and objectives. We haven't included things that are practical in terms of how our departments can work together and how we can use the resources that we have in the most efficient manner, and having them coordinate with one another as they're taking on their various responsibilities in the community. There is one item I think is Council 100. Is still here. Oh, okay. He did have an item that I wanted to add on here, which was to include a well, I'll wait for him to come back and see if because he's the second on this motion. So we'll come back. He might want to make that friendly himself, but it involves with our information technology department implementing an online dashboard that could be updated monthly with information that the public can access regarding our data and our our, our, our tracking of of our successes in the city. And finally, I know I have a resident here, but I do want to mention and I promise the residents that had to go home to take care of their kids that I know. I'm very well aware that in my district there was a petition started. The petition was written to the mayor and the chief of police. And I know there's there was a group here tonight that wanted to talk about the petition and talk about why they feel that residential quality of life issues need to be more of a focus when we're talking about the issue of homelessness. So I look forward to hearing from our one remaining member of the public eye today. Thank you, Councilman Gonzales. Yes. Thank you to Councilwoman Price for bringing this forward. I think any additional information we can provide and we can we can receive and figure out is is the best. However, it is very detailed and I know it's very lengthy and I appreciate her being very open and understanding that there have been reports that have come back already. What I would suggest and I have a couple of friendlies, but we have done a lot of work already in this, I think. And I know it's sometimes hard for the public to understand what the city is currently doing being in downtown. A lot of my residents, even though we have seen many individuals experiencing homelessness, they still don't understand the extent to which the city is doing. I personally was at the homeless count, which was on my birthday. Because I wanted to see it for myself. And I think that there's often a lot of residents who do not see that for themselves. They don't see what work we're doing the city departments are doing. I've had stakeholder meetings as well with many of the service providers which are located in downtown. And they don't even talk to each other. So I think there is a gap there in terms of coordinating and what we can do there. So a few things I've been thinking about. We have a multitude of different initiatives. We've passed policies of, you know, the Fuze fellow, I initiated a state of homelessness item, which was the March 9th report that came back. Affordable housing, the heart team. So many of us have had different initiatives, I would suggest and this is my friendly one of my friendly amendments to Councilmember Pearce. I'm sorry Price it is late tonight I'm sorry is is perhaps asking our city management staff to aggregate all of this information and put it all together. I know we can all look it up and register, but to aggregate the successes that we've had, whether that's Fuze fellow and all of the reports, to just have it all in one place for for the public to kind of jump off of that is. I think I spoke to Kelly Colby, our Health and Human Services Director, some time ago, about even an infographic that shows the services that we're doing some sort of marketing campaign. I don't think people often know the success. Again, the successes that we've had with homelessness and the fact that we're down in our numbers, we just don't we don't talk about that in the homeless count. Information comes back, you know, in a very city like document. So I don't think it's anything fascinating to the eye. Not that it's fascinating information, but I think that we could maybe do a little bit better in marketing, that is coordination in services, because I think a lot of what Council Member Price is talking about is already being done. So is that something that we. Absolutely I think we can certainly do that. And I think that's one of the things the agenda item speaks to, and we can put that together with our team and Instagram. Yes. Okay, great. And then another thing I will say as well in terms of technology, because in speaking with the service providers, I think a lot of the disconnect is with the individuals out on the ground and the you know, I had about 15 stakeholders, First Congregational Church, Rescue Mission, MHRA, all of them in one, you know , all of the churches you can imagine COA all in one meeting and they didn't even realize the services that each other were providing. And I think that again is a big miss. So if we had some sort of a tech, I don't know if there's a platform we can provide for these social service providers. You know, one of them told me, oh, I didn't even know that the church across the street offered this service, whatever service it was. We don't even know what time of day food is being provided, whether it's breakfast, lunch, dinner. So I think that there's a way to. Perhaps streamline that. I don't know if there's a technology platform that could be done again. Maybe it's another infographic. We just need to think a little creatively there. So thank you again, Councilmember Price for this item. I look forward to the information. I will just say, though, that 120 days is a little short. My item didn't come back for a year. So I think that perhaps providing additional time for for city staff to come back with that information would be great. Thank you very much. Thank you. Councilmember Pearce, we we have councilmembers. I'm just confusing my I'm just trying to think I'm just thinking ahead of of the items. Is this okay? I want to thank my colleague. Councilwoman. Oh, you're thinking council member. Councilwoman, I get you. Okay. Councilwoman Price for bringing this item forward. Doing pronouns now. There you go. There you go. I think that's you know, it highlights a lot of the work that we've already done, everything from the Hart team to the previous work, everything with our police department and our health department. And it it is a lot of information. But I think that the important thing is that, you know, we had a plan, a ten year plan, and that plans expired. And so going along and saying, where are we at now? What do we need to do for the next ten years, knowing what we know and what we've been able to accomplish. And so I'm happy to support this. Obviously, I think when we're talking about how we provide it. The first question is how do we get information? So how do we know how many people we're serving? How do we know how many calls are coming in? All of that information is so important to be able to deliver better services and to better be able to. City manager. Can you let me know how many times do multiple department heads meet in a month in regards to homelessness? Every week. Every week. And which departments are doing those meetings? It's it's a group of probably six departments PD, Fire, Health, Human Services, Parks and Recreation, City Manager's Office, Technology Services, Public Works. So even information like that, I think is really important to be able to tell our story to constituents and to say we're working really hard, you know? And I think sometimes the biggest challenge is when we're in the weeds doing the work. It's hard to sing our praises. And because we're so busy doing the work and. The teams working really hard. Yeah. And I see that. And I saw that when I came to council in a very different way than when I was outside of council. And so being able to tell that story and to be able to say, here's where we're troubleshooting, here's how we're helping out. So I think this is a good item. I think it's making sure that we know the impact of these things. So like the Hart team, you know, I would love to have one with each battalion. When we talk about the budget, that is something that we've seen them be successful on. So I don't have any amendments or anything, but I just wanted to say, you know, I think it's a good item if we can have enough time to make sure it comes back with, you know, all the information that we want. I think that would be helpful. Thank you. Councilman Ringo. I'll make it quick. The the study is pretty comprehensive. I understand that, but it's all concentrated on Long Beach. South Street in Long Beach. And homelessness is a citywide issue. And there are many areas where we have homelessness up here. And I think that we need to also reach out to our partners in the region, to the county of L.A., to Caltrans, to help us when we have those issues involving the freeway, the underpasses, the river. Because when we have issues that especially in my district in the seventh. We were like. I sent a task force out there. They know what the borders are. They throw stuff over the fence into the county site and in the county say that in doing so, I think that this study, whatever we're doing here, has to include connections or articulation, if you will, with our county contracting and Caltrans and any other agency that that is that is affected by homelessness. I wish you could include that. Thank you, Councilman Mongo. I think. I have lately been attending the countywide homeless meetings, and I know that in these large meetings we're in discussions and I want to repeat the words of my colleagues that Long Beach is doing. Exceptionally well as compared to of the other even smaller cities that that have sometimes in some categories, considerably more resources. But I do think that we could be instead of recreating the wheel. When we talk about these systems and how to put data online, we have the fire department who hopefully is moving towards the electronic patient system. There's a homeless button in that category. And as we educate people in public safety across the region, it should be a component of doing their job and not a separate mapping system. And I know that we have so many different systems and different departments. I would just. Heed us not to move into a new and another system, but find components of our current systems that can be modified and integrated and posted on open. Data. Thank you. Thank you. Councilwoman Price. So I absolutely. Councilman, your youngest comments are well noted. And I think this should be kind of looking at the region if you look at the different departments. So what we did was we tried to research what opportunities there were in each department. And Councilwoman Pearce is correct. We have done a lot of these things. But if you if you look at the item, for example, we're not saying let's create a Hart team. We're saying we'd like some data on the heart team's successes and can we add more and how much would that cost? So moving into the budget cycle, same with quality of life officers, you know, how effective are they? How much would it cost and how much time would it take us to train them up? So absolutely. And, you know, there was another item that I didn't mention earlier that I know Councilman Austin and Councilwoman Gonzales were involved in involving where the jail, where people donate money to they donate directly to an individual or should they donate to like a meter, artistic meter, and that money would go to a primary source and that would get distributed. And that's a really great idea. Other cities have done that, too. Councilman, you're on this point. So studying what other cities have done is is is helpful. But we've done a lot of things. But I think in several of these areas, it's important for us to think about what's the next step. So what are we doing to educate people, businesses and residents about what all the experts believe, which is you shouldn't be donating individually to people. You should be donating to organizations that can help people, that can lead to long term sustainable. So what are we doing in that regards? And, you know, every once in a while you mention an idea and people will say, yeah, we're already doing that. Well, if the council doesn't know that we're doing that, then it's really not we're not able to transfer that to our residents. So if we are doing it, we should know about it. So and if we are doing it, then the report's going to be a little bit easier to complete than previously had we have thought. So that's great if we're doing it. But if we are doing it, then, you know, is there an opportunity for us to do something better or learn something from another county? Like if you look at the public works section, there's a lot of research in here from work that's been done around the country in terms of service days and opportunities to have job training skills and things like that. And that's based on things that have been done regionally that may not be viable for for our city, but it's something I'd like us to explore. So again, I would like to ask my colleagues for their support. And and I think Councilwoman Gonzales makes a good point about the timing. I think 120 days may be unrealistic, although based on what I've heard, we've already done a lot of this stuff, so it might just be repackaging it. So I would say, you know, as soon as possible and I know I did this. Does the city manager noted the social impact bond item come back? I think we brought that about eight months ago or so. Does that come back yet? No, it has not come back. We can give. You a report tomorrow. I think it's shortly. Okay. Well, we. Weave that in here, too. So if we see something, we're already working on it. I can just come back with this, but I understand these things take time. Thank you. Thank you, Vice Mayor. I just want to applaud, you know, Council Councilwoman Pryce, all the signers and everyone's done work on this issue. It's an important issue across the county. You know, the more we talk about it, the more we engage on it. I don't think we can go wrong. So. So you have my support. Thank you. Great. We're going to let me just add one thing also. I do want to thank and I'm glad everyone else everyone has touched on. This is our staff, by the way, and I see Kelly out there and I just think it's really important to thank you guys are amazing. And you guys get pounded so hard in the community every single day for doing literally God's work and the kind of work that so many folks are not interested in actually engaging on. And your entire team and I've had a chance to meet I'm so proud of them and I'm so proud of all of our partners that are out there every single day. And I see some of them that are here today. So thank you guys for being here. And Mayor, do you recognize Officer Johnny Dotson who's out? WHITFIELD Absolutely. I mean, Johnny, I see our team. You guys are awesome. And I also just I think it's important to note that it is true we have had population shifts. But what what the data is coming back to it were Long Beach is in regards to the data versus every single one of our neighbors and the state of California is amazing what we're doing with the crisis that is across the state of California. And so I applaud you guys for doing that. And that by no no means does that mean that we still don't have serious issues and that we haven't seen population shifts here? And that's cause major concerns for a lot of neighborhoods. And so we know that is obviously true. I will I will say what I think is important. We're doing, I think, almost more than than most cities and agencies. And what's great about Measure H is it would allow us to double our capacity. And so I know that you guys are working as part of the budget process that we're actually going to see pretty dramatic increases in the budget around homelessness issues. And I think in all departments, I think, Mr. West, I know that you're working as part of your budget to present kind of what all the departments are doing around homelessness. And so I think that's something that we all have to look forward to, and I appreciate that. But I want to go back to something that Councilwoman Gonzales said, which I think what struck me is part of the big issue is that we're also we're not communicating, I think, as probably well as we should be what we're doing and then listening to the neighborhoods about what it is that they're seeing on the ground at what we can do to address those things. And so, I mean, the conversations around what is actually happening, what our neighborhood partners are doing, how we communicate that to the community, does the council have all the information that they need to be kind of ambassadors in their neighborhoods and get the information out? So I think those are all actually very valuable conversations that I hope that we also have in the course of the next few weeks and months ahead as this reports put together. So I think it's a good item and I think it's good it's always good to have more information and have more conversations about a topic that we're all working on pretty, pretty strongly. So thank you to all of the council people that signed on to this. And Councilman Andrus. Yes. And real quickly. I want to thank Mrs. Price to bring this item forward, because I think with her hard work and compassion and with which we all should have for the homelessness, I think we really make a difference in Long Beach. We have to continue to work as hard as they have been because this is all over the country, homelessness, and we must have that compassion to really get serious behind trying to help out our fellow brothers and sisters. Out there struggling. Thank you very much. And we're going to go do a public comment. Please come forward. We're going to have this this lady go first, sir, just because she's been waiting for a long time. Go ahead, ma'am. Thank you. Good evening or good morning. Whatever it is by now. My name is Lauren Wakefield. I live in Belmont Heights in District three. Excuse me. I knew this would happen. I would really urge you to take a look at that petition that you've all been given. The 1300 people who signed it have included 1300 comments. And we have a very different outlook on this problem than you're presenting right now. First of all, this is not about homeless people who are sincerely down and out and in need. We don't see it as a homeless problem. We see it as a public safety and a crime problem. And that's really what's happening with us. Long Beach receives a lot of grant money to provide services to the homeless, yet we've been told that 90% of that population refuses those services. And we were told that by your city homeless outreach coordinator. Even if we invest more money into more programs, there's no way to compel people to use these services. I'm asking the city to go to the heart of the problem by addressing this firm as props 47 and 57. These laws have released a tidal wave of criminals to the city and other cities. Drug abusers and thieves are doing very well thanks to these early release laws. There was supposed to be a period of public discussion regarding. The nonviolent peace. I ask the city to please address their concerns with the state. We're also asking the city to give feedback to the state on that egregious law that says stealing anything valued at under $950 is okay. That alone is causing a huge amount of chaos in the community. People are stealing everything, walking out of vans at traffic circles. With value about $1,000. A day, and that's just what they catch. While the state may take some time to change this ill conceived law. Can we draft some type of local ordinance that addresses it, please? It should not be just a misdemeanor to steal something valued under $950. Please untie the hands of law enforcement, even with the stifling limitations of the props. We have city ordinances that could be enforced. Please streamline the police paperwork, give us more police officers and patrols, and let the vagrants and criminals know we're not going to continue to lie down. And roll over. And while we're very appreciative of being. Put on the agenda. Tonight, we can't wait 120 days to see results. Crime is escalating. The community is at a boiling point. We must have budget for public safety, increased police and general protection for the public. Don't wait until businesses and the tax base flee. And tweakers, vagrants and criminals are all that's left in our city. Thank you. Thank you very much. Next speaker, please. You're here. You know, it was good what she said. Okay, Council. This. I have to ask this. I have to ask this. Why do we always see a unanimous vote? It seems like you. But before we got here, because then I'm hearing people talk and I'm hearing them say, okay, are they talking as if it's already been done? And I don't really like that. And I mean, you have a diverse, diverse group of people here, and it seems like it's already we don't have it. We're just here to show up and see what you guys are going to do. It's supposed to be we the people. This is supposed to be America. It seems like it's getting more and more socialist and. Ms.. Pierce, when you were going asked what was up about that happy birthday, Karl Marx. Because, you know, I'm American. I don't I don't think that's funny. I don't see George Washington on your Facebook. But Karl Marx, let's make sure. Sure. We're talking about this topic. Right? Well, this is the topic, communism and socialism. And I'm a capitalist. I'm a free market person. So that is the topic. So so I'm asking her that's not representative. I can ask her. Well, I'm making my statement so I don't like that at all. I'm here to tell you. I don't like I don't like plain whatever you up with that. I don't like none of that. You know, we need to keep America for Americans. This is the topic. And as far as as far as homelessness, it needs to be helped. But I was here when you passed for $25 million to help them. I don't see nothing changing out there like the lady just said. Most of that and most of us know this isn't these are just crazy people. These are straight tweakers and dopers. They don't want to get inside. They don't want a job. They don't want no money. They don't want the hotel part of the GTA because that would be less smoking. They doing, let's call it what it is. A lot of people don't want that. They want they want to be out there with a cop doing what they're doing and then you acting like, okay, we need to keep our poor and money. No, we don't know that. A lot of people need to be in jail. And then the streets that no goes on out there. I know the stealing. I know when it gets dark. What's going to go on out there? Hi. Everybody's paying. Who works? All these working people paying. So let's stop playing, playing joke, playing games here and acting like there's a different problem. And all this money game, whatever it is, conspiracy, the RICO that needs to be dealt with right here. This seems like a racket to me, that's all. I leave it at that. It needs to stop. Just turn around and really get to doing something and you know, that's it. Thank you, Nick Speaker, please. Good evening. I'm Gary Morris, and I live in Mm Heights. I do real. Kind of big experiences with homelessness. One is president of my. Association and again. Councilwoman Price's my constituent. Thank you. And my constituents talk to me about this issue frequently. And they want something done now, sooner rather than later. And second, I have a board member who spends most of her time on just shopping cart retrieval, which is an associated issue to transcend homelessness. So that's how we do it. You know, in terms of how it affects me. Probably the most dramatic affect for me is we have a property in the Willmar Historic District on a Sunday morning going to work to work on it. I drove by on Anaheim inside a guy laying on the sidewalk. So I drove past and then I thought, you know, be a better guy, turn around, go check them out. So I called PD. They came up and picked him up. He was. Dead. So it was cold. It was sunny. It was Sunday. And it's a real issue. I see a separation between and homelessness, I think the two different issues. I agree that people don't always want to come in from the streets. I don't personally understand it, but I've seen it. I've experienced it with a friend of mine. He chose to live on the streets, chose alcohol, chose meth. I don't get it, but it's a problem. 120 days may seem short for y'all. But from my side of the where I am. Sooner rather than later. And I appreciate Commander Griffin, Officer Dodson. For all the work they do for us and everybody else who I don't know. We really appreciate it. So thank you. And approve this and move on with it quickly and come up with a hard hitting strategic plan to solve these issues. Thank you. Next week, a police. Hello again. It's Silvia Contreras, District eight. And I do believe that we do need to help the homeless. But I have a different perspective. So. One of the things that I love is I love history. With that, I could tell you this from what I've read. Homeless and prostitution have been way before Christi's homeless back then, probably very different from today. Some years ago, I did a study on child support. Blessings. Maybe people know this, maybe they don't. But it wasn't until the mid to early 20th century that if a woman was divorced or her father or her husband passed away, the children went to the husband's family regardless. And if they didn't like her, they could kick her out. Eventually it came where the woman can take care of the child. So where does that come with this? Is that in the process of child support? I've also had had done the study that a lot of men don't want to pay child support, so they become homeless. And that to me is like a flip. So do we help those men that are homeless because they don't want to pay child support? I've always wondered, what are we doing to be able to find out why are they homeless? We know the problem is homeless, but why are they? So in order we know. In order to have a solution, we should really delve into the. Problem right now, homeless is very general. And then let's figure out those programs is also very general. So what can we do to drill down to the cause of the problem to really help it out? That's it. Thank you. Thank you very much, Nick. Speaker, Police. Minister. How are you? Good morning, you. Good to see you. Good to see you. I know. We all know each. I think the best thing all you can do is keep studying everything to create more jobs. LE True, but it's no. I know all of you working on the contract for the search tonight and we know about the Starbucks coffee. You know, that's part of my business support for managing more people to know managers won't let city council team load more people. No, no, no. To support the store. I love they live Long Beach. Well, we love homemade stuff. So that's your chance to speak. So the gentleman at the podium is speaking. From the stables. Manager Willow Lumby is telling me all of you came out there, me and Deanne, to talk about different things and put save the gold medal and any goals with those kids a couple. So. I think that's all. How? Save for the night key. Starting to create more chance for me. Sandy Hall's been here a lot of years lately. They got all the money and make it crazy, man. Thank you so much. Thank you. You have a good night. Have a good night. You too. See you tomorrow. Okay. Okay. Thank you so much. Yes. Next picture, please. Hello. My name is Paul Gomez here from Long Beach. I do want to thank all you guys for the hard work you guys are putting in on the homeless situation. And Officer Dawson, I know he puts in a lot of hard work, too, and been to some of the meetings he's had. And but when I walk outside my door, it's a totally different picture than what I'm hearing. I walk outside my door and I see, like Miss Wakefield said, nothing but basically tweakers and thieves. When I say thieves, the guys that are standing on my corner, they're riding around brand new bikes every day. They're stealing my bicycle. I'm retrieving my bicycle from them. I'm calling the Long Beach PD and I know their hands are tied. They come to basically hand my bike back to me and they can't take the guy to jail. I ride a nice bike, a really nice bike. They steal my girlfriend's bike at the same time. I retrieve her bike from another guy. It's just it's a cycle that is it's a cycle that's just not stopping and it's just getting worse and worse. I walk outside my door. I live in a nice place. I walk outside my door. I'm embarrassed to bring my friends over. I live in waterfront property and you walk outside and there's the same guy that still do bikes holding a sign. I help me with food and the same guy that's holding that sign is walking into CVS or Gelson's and walking in and walking right out with everything he wants. And and it just seems like there's nothing being done about it. I know you guys are working very hard at it and and the statistics look great and everything, but that's not what I see when I walk out my front door and I don't know what the fix is , but something's got to change. It's like this. This problem wasn't here years ago. There was the few homeless guys we had in our neighborhood. Everyone kind of knew them, waved at them. They were nice guys. These are a bunch of drug, drug addicts and a bunch of thieves. At the end of the day, what I see the majority of them, and it's just very disappointing that nothing's being done in my eyes to fix a problem. I know we're working at it, but that's not what I'm seeing. So whatever you guys can do to help out. Greatly appreciate it. Thank you, sir. Officer Dodson, for all your help, too. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Next speaker, please. Hello. First things first. Humanity predates Holmes. So homelessness obviously existed before Holmes have existed. But I myself was very curious about whether there were just not enough not enough shelters or or why people weren't going to the shelters. Because you obviously have you have your your drug addled individuals who are not exactly capable of handling being around other people. So they tend to not go to shelters. They tend to be off on their own loners sort of situation going on there. But there are plenty of people who are homeless, who aren't drug addled, who are who still don't seem to go into the to the shelters and such. So I have asked I've taken up the opportunities I've had to ask them, because if you want to know about something, ask people who are most involved with it. If you want to know about the Dakota Access pipeline, talk to people who are engineers in the field and find out what the actual hazards are. Not listening to a hullabaloo and all sorts of other things. So what I've been hearing is that it's it's an issue of sanitary, unsanitary conditions. They're better off. They they their they they have a better chance at maintaining some level of comfortable cleanliness on their own, washing up in whatever bathroom they can find or come. Across using a bar of soap and a and and a and a washcloth. And wherever they can, they can they can make it happen. And maybe catching a shower at some some certain place they found that's decent, because when they've gone into shelters, they come out with bedbugs. So then all of a sudden, instead of just going in and getting a night's sleep or what have you, a gal told me about having to, you know, then shave her entire body and and go replace all of her clothing. And it's so I'm not I'm not trying to throw the the shelter operators under the bus. I've never stayed in one. I don't know what. I haven't experienced it myself. But if everybody I've talked to has had issues with it, then it's there's there's something going on there. There's a missing link as far as making sure that it's that it's a safe, healthy environment for people to go into. And I'm not sure exactly what be taken. Bedbugs are really terrible, so I don't have a great solution for it. But that's that's what I've heard. So it's not necessarily that there aren't enough beds. Um, so that's it. Thank you very much. Okay, next speaker, please. And then these are the last three speakers that are on the line. Hi. Thank you. My name is Amanda moore. I am a resident of the second district and totally brand new. Into local government. And this is trial by fire tonight. Wow. I, I just wanted to maybe make. Some suggestions about how to better involve the community in dispelling a lot of the fear and the unfounded will. Unfounded fears, certainly losing your bike again and again and having to retrieve it again and again and going through that is a hassle. It's wrong, it's criminal, it's not right. But a lot of these criminals that are making these they're making these choices. They have severe mental health problems. And we spoke about that earlier tonight. And it was passed, which is great. I think we'll. See quite a bit of decrease once Buck. Is completed and we're able to use that. But perhaps if you can work with neighborhood associations directly and people in the neighborhood to sort of engage the community. Members to have to. Be reminded of compassion for these people that they are you and I, we have been there before. I have never been homeless, but there is nothing to say that I could maybe be homeless. At some point. And I would want. To be treated with the same respect and compassion that any human. Deserves. So whether they have committed ridiculous crimes or not. We still need to give these people chance after chance. To help them. And I think talking with residents, dispelling fear and mental health outreach will help as well. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Next speaker, please. I know it's late. My name is Ramon. I'm from the fifth District. I don't know what it takes to. All my life, I've seen a lot of the homeless in Long Beach. I've. I run across the community and I see it all. I don't know what it takes to help this issue. It's an extremely tough nut to crack. I thought I saw it all until one day Stacy Mungo held a meeting in in Hartwell Park in a golf course cafeteria. And I heard Marie Knight say that she the city, spent about a half a million dollars trying to clear out tunnels that were in Eldorado Park. And I was just freaking out. That was amazing to me to hear something like that. I have helped some of the homeless. I've been fortunate enough at least not to be in a situation like that. But I've also helped two veterans get off of the homeless stuff after, you know, a long time working with them and just saying hello and giving them some of the information with a multi-service center that Stacy Mungo's chief of staff, Christine, gave me. And it got them to completely change her life. So I just wanted to just say thanks to this, the city and the community at least for having the multi-service center. It's been such a an important aspect of the city that I mean, it it doesn't it's so difficult to find just to help one person and they just keep working at it and they keep working at it. And you just got to say, you know, you're doing a yeoman's job just like what the mayor has said. So I just want to thank Johnny Dobson and and Commander Griffin for all the work that they've done. I know that we're kind of moving them around. We're not able to help them too much. But anything that we can do is is great. And I just want to thank the city for all its work that it's done. Thank you. Finally, Mr. Breland. Yes, Larry Bond. When I was a young kid, we used to go down to the riverbed in the San Gabriel River. It was before it smelled and was all trees. It's a riparian area, bamboo. And yes, we were down. There were hobos and were hobos. Now we have homeless people and those are guys who just didn't want to be inside. But here's here's an issue. In the last recession, we had a 15% unemployment. And people could go from a good paying job, have a house, have a car, and lose a job, lose the car, lose the house and be homeless. Those folks we have truly have to take care of. Safety net has to be there. But I'll never forget the igloos that L.A. City put up for the homeless. Remember that? Off of the freeway. And what happened? They took them out because the people wouldn't. The homeless people wouldn't go in. They wouldn't go into those igloos because they had rules. And the rules were you couldn't smoke pot and you couldn't do crack or cocaine. The homeless people don't like rules. So what scares me is you're going to build a whole bunch of houses and you're not going to have any guests because now we're going to have marijuana is going to be okay unless we put a nonsmoking rule into those homes. If you say, okay. Homeless, you can come in and. You can smoke pot. And by the way, you have a bed. Budweiser won't have another bud. Bud. And so we'll have high people in our thing like everybody. Nobody has a solution to this because there is a multi layer of schizophrenia, of drug addiction, of alcoholism. I don't know the thing, but I just say let's be cautious on how much room we spend on homeless housing versus fixing the solution with the people. Anyway, thank you for listening.

We have also our archivist from Seattle City Council, and the Ledger Department has brought down the archive materials that are outside in the lobby here for folks to take a look at. This is celebrating this week. 100 years ago began the Seattle general strike where for multiple days people came together across sectors and across industries to stand in solidarity. We have the opportunity this week to highlight not only labor history, but everything that Labor continues to do to stand up for working families, to organize new unions and new sectors, and to make sure that more working families have the opportunity to help provide for their families, even if they're not in union jobs. And the unions have been fighting for paid family leave, paid sick leave, raising the minimum wage, doing things that support not just union workers, but also the workers at large. So as we celebrate this year in 100 year anniversary celebration of the Seattle general strike, I wanted to make sure that folks knew that in our committee this Thursday, we will have the opportunity to hear from the University of Washington labor professors and report on the state of labor from the new Washington State Labor Council, AFL-CIO President Brown and Executive Secretary from the Martin Luther King County Central Labor Council, Nicole Grant.

I've also just mailed to the full council and will make available online as well the full list of activities happening throughout the week. For example, there is a presentation tonight on the Seattle general strike from James Gregory, who provided a literature literature review of the Seattle general strike tomorrow, Wednesday, the sixth.

Vice Mayor Richardson. I want to reserve my comments after the staff report, please. Mr. West. Mike Conway Mayor Garcia, Member City Council. This item relates to a future development. Property located at the northeast corner of Atlantic Avenue and Artesia. Boulevard. This property contains 2.14 acres and is undeveloped. An RFP was released and four submittals were received. The selection panel unanimously preferred the proposal submitted by frontier real estate investments. While the price offered for the property was slightly. Lower than the highest price, the total investment value. Was significantly higher. The developer proposals proposes to develop 13,200 square feet of commercial and retail buildings with proposed uses that are needed. Within the local community, including. A commercial bank. Staff request the council approve. The recommended action, and I stand ready to answer your questions. Thank you. I'll go ahead and give my comments now, Mr. Mayor. Okay. So I'm obviously thrilled to be approving this project tonight. Having worked, you know, as chief of staff to Councilman Neal, who's here in the audience and working in this community for four, six, seven years. This is the one project that, you know, people for decades have asked about when are we going to develop this vacant lot on Atlantic in Artesia? So so tonight, this is the second of three major ninth District successor, Regency Park properties that's moving forward and really anchors the corner of Atlantic as well as Artesia, the developer Frontier Real Estate Investments has extensive experience and experience in development construction. I was very impressed with the proposal that they submitted. They demonstrated a strong focus on community needs, and it was very responsive to community interests. They've committed to civic engagement, continuing civic engagement through the course of this process, setting a new design standard for for our community and helping us to achieve our goals that, you know, we've we've we've looked for for a long time a number of amenities that have been lacking in District nine and North Long Beach, namely a financial institution targeting a sit down restaurant and retail space spaces for the community to gather. And I want to borrow former Vice Mayor Lowenthal comment, the public living room, a coffee shop and a development that really anchors much of the other activities taking place on the Artesian Atlantic corridor. So this is this is pretty huge for for us here in North Long Beach. We're really excited about this. I'm confident that the developer will fulfill the vision of the site and look forward to the full development along the timeline. So thank you. And those are my comments. Councilman Ranga. I totally support this motion and I congratulate Richardson on a successful project. And I also want to congratulate Vice Mayor Richardson, but also staff. You guys worked very hard on this. Very, very hard. And I love all the development that's happening in Long Beach right now. I love it. I love this. I want to fill all these frickin open parcels with development. The more, the better. Come on down. Develop our city, the more. It's missing a couple flagpoles. But besides that. Any public comment? Please come forward. Yes. Josh Butler with Housing Long Beach. We two commend the city for being able to sell all these vacant lots and develop them as well. We just want to be sure and I know a speaker came to council recently to ask if we're following the Surplus Land Act, which requires that these properties be offered up for affordable housing development as well as perhaps parks space as well. This has been a major issue in other cities and including Oakland, which had to turn back around on the sale of many of their properties to provide opportunities for public space, affordable housing and given the amount of public land that we've been selling off on a regular basis here all throughout the downtown, and now we're seeing already a lot sell sold off in other cities. I just want to make sure that we don't come back and have to look at that. We did not follow the Surplus Land Act and if any council members have had any conversations about that at all. Thank you. We just want to go on record as at least questioning this and the sale of other properties as well. Well, Miami property, the Long Beach Boulevard property that was recently sold as well. Questions about whether or not affordable housing developers had an opportunity at purchasing that property. Thank you. We have addressed that question. Mr. City Attorney, do you want to comment on that? Yes, we have complied with the Surplus Land Act and that notice was sent. I think you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Good evening, Mayor. City Council and Staff. My name is Tasha Hunter with the Uptown Business Improvement District. And I want to say that we're very excited to have this development frontier come. The community has we've had some focus groups since I've been in the position as the business district manager and one of the common denominators and common things said was that the community wanted something to do, they wanted a place to go, and they wanted they wanted a nice sit down restaurant bank and as vice mayor said, coffee shop, different things. So we're very excited. The business district supports having Frontier there and we look forward to breaking ground. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker. Good evening, esteemed Mayor. City Council. My name is Steve Neal. Address on file. And I would like to thank the city council and Councilmember Richards, Vice Mayor Richardson, for his diligence in this project. I can speak on behalf of the communities of North Long Beach and they are very excited about this development. This parcel has been sitting vacant prior to my term, going back into the term of my predecessor. So it is well overdue. So I'd like to commend you on your hard work and thank you for your diligence. Congratulations. Steve, I just want to tell you, we desperately miss you. I just getting your. Let me say something. After after sitting here tonight. I loved it while I was here. But you guys are doing a bang up job and continue to fight. I just get it. And congratulations, Councilmember, on the major appointment. Next speaker, please. Hi. Good evening. My name is Susan Doan and I'm a property owner in Long Beach. I'm also a broker and I really want to say thank you for letting me speak tonight. And Councilman Richardson, congratulation on your magnificent project. These RDA properties have been sitting vacant and unused long enough since the I guess the idea went away in 2011. I have one question. There is over a 500,000 shortage of housing in the state of California. L.A. County alone has 50,000. These are facts that you can substantiate. I also have a client in Long Beach who is an affordable housing developer, and he indicated to me on numerous occasions that Long Beach was unfriendly to to them as far as their developing. So they went out of the area and even out of state. My question is, can we use some of these RDA properties for affordable housing? That's it. Thank you. Thank you. And I do know that just just to clarify. So the way that these properties work, I believe we've actually had about over 200 parcels across the city that we're selling. And part of the process is that the city is also limited on what actually can be develop on the site. And so there's actually a state stamped, approved, approved process of what and how we have to sell these properties. And in many cases, in some cases, it's to the highest bidder. In other cases, it's a pre-development agreement with the city. In other cases, it's just a fire sale on the property. And so I just want to also clarify that with the city part of this process, the city lot has lost a lot of control in how to develop these parcels as well. But we have a motion in a second. And again, congratulations on this is fantastic. Please cast your vote. Motion carries. Thank you. Next item, please. Item 16. Let's go back to 17. I'm sorry, did we do it? I don't think we did. 17.

This is consistent with the recommendations of the House Committee. I do have an amendment to Appendix F that I distributed councilmembers earlier today. It's specifically the form that is contained in Appendix F of attachment A called the Excess Property Proposed Use Form. And so I moved to amend Appendix F of attachment a. Second. That's been moved in second and that attachment A be amended. Did you want to speak more to it comes I heard. Well, if I could, I think it would be good for folks who might have missed the email from the greenspace Seattle Greenspaces Coalition today. This specific amendment would address the, as I said, the property review process determination form. It's a it's a form that's used in the surplus property disposition process. And the original language that passed out of committee is the sentence is there strong community support for one or more of the proposed options? The email that we received today from the Seattle Greenspaces Coalition expressed a strong and longstanding interest in the use of surplus city properties. They concur with our goals to expedite the use of these properties for housing purposes. But they raised a concern about the language because the language is on the current FASB form covers not only support for options, but also allows for any position, for instance, neutral or negative, and therefore allows for a wider range of constituent comment rather than just sort of a binary binary. We support it. The amendment would restore the language currently used by IFRS in the form with one change. It would replace the word citizens with individuals and so it would read have individuals, community groups and other interested parties contacted the city regarding any of the proposed options. This amendment would in no way affect the prioritization of affordable housing. The primary goal of the legislation or the abbreviated timeline for review of affordable housing is a separate issue altogether and a separate a separate fact revision to question to question two that passed in committee would remain as as as as passed by the committee members. The amendment was run by the Department of Finance and Administrative Services and they are fine with with the changes proposed. Very good things for that. Nation. So we're going to take the amendment first. Any other comments on the amendment that's been moved in Second Amendment attached in a. Is a minute by substituting opinion appendix f all those in favor say I. I oppose. The ayes have it. So now we have a resolution that has been amended. Does you want to say any other words on the overall resolution? Again. Are you just to restate that this is consistent with the recommendation of the Housing Affordability and Livability Agenda Committee, looking at ways that we can use existing property within city ownership for housing and expediting the ability to do so, which the city has already has a really good track record over the last two years as compared to previous years. This can just speed speed that up further. Very good. Any further comments? Okay. Those in favor of adopting the resolution as a minute, please vote i. I. Those oppose vote no. The motion carries and the resolution as amended is adopted and chair will sign it. Please read item seven and eight into the record.", "result": "A RESOLUTION amending procedures for the Evaluation of the Reuse and Disposal of the City\u2019s Real Property, to update certain portions of the procedures and expedite the disposition of properties for affordable housing development, consistent with the recommendations of the Housing Affordability and Livability Agenda (HALA) Advisory Committee adopted by the City Council in Resolution 31622."}

{"input": "And importantly. Communication from Councilwoman Allen, Councilmember Arango, Councilwoman Price, Councilman Austin Recommendation to request city attorney to draft an ordinance to enact kid's zones to find a safe spaces for children at local parks, playgrounds, beaches, and other areas intended for use by children. Councilwoman Allen. Yes. I thank you, Vice Mayor. And also I want to thank Councilmember Ranga for his partnership on this item. I heard from many of my residents and folks that are concerned about adults misusing public playgrounds and spaces. Recently throughout the city, we've seen spaces designed for children vandalized and misused. Parks in my district as Miracle on Fourth and Promenade Square Park are impacted by ongoing loitering issues which discourage park usage by children or their guardians. Given these trends, I think it's necessary that we look at ways to create safe spaces for our children at our parks. By establishing kid's zones, we can assure the city, playground equipment and play areas specifically designed for children remain safe and remain available spaces for use by children. So we have to take steps to protect these children. And so they also can enjoy the parks and the playgrounds. Thank you very much. Thank you. Councilman Price. I want to thank Councilwoman Allen for asking me to sign on to this item. We I think it's imperative that we have spaces that are designed for children and used by children. Just recently on our one apparel playground structure, we've had to do numerous repairs because it's such a great structure that adults have been also using it and trying to to be on the equipment. And it's impacted the equipment and it's used by the children because of the damage that has resulted. Additionally, I think it's sometimes intimidating for children when they see adults in a play space and just the way that they're trained to be wary of adults, strangers, makes them not feel as comfortable in those spaces. And I think it's important that we create areas where children feel safe to play and have equipment that's appropriate size and designed for their ages. We've put a lot of effort and care into designing age appropriate play equipment in our parks and recreational areas. And and so I think this item is a really good one to address some of those concerns. I do have a question for the city manager. When this policy goes into effect, would there be any opportunity to do a period of targeted enforcement just to make sure that people are getting education and outreach regarding the new policy and some of the limitations of adult use of those play structures. So before you bring back an ordinance and then vote on it, we do want to bring you back some information in a memo about just resources, capacity, enforcement options that we can certainly look at, that we do see this as kind of dealing with some of the more a one off occurrences where we have some some real issues where there's permanent, you know, restrictive use of of an area, you know, that is within our resources kind of looking at every every area all the time is going to stretch us a little thin. But we can certainly look at informing people. We're going to look at signage as well so we can bring that back as part of the memo. Yeah, I mean, I think about some really hot areas that are both being used by adults and children right now, but perhaps designed for children like some of the playgrounds on the beach, some of the widget activities that we have. Certainly they were not designed for the size and weight pressures that they're getting. So that would be great. Thanks. Thank you. Council member Urunga. Thank you. And I want to thank all of my colleagues for drawing on this. I have a couple of parts of my in my district that were have recently been damaged. And I think that it's incredibly important to have a zone where kids can play and be kids and not adults being kids . I have a question for I guess, is Mr. Brant available for parks? No. Yes. Okay. Yeah. Can you give a brief summary as to the cost that we have incurred over the last two years or so of damage caused by adults on our playgrounds? Yeah, certainly I can think of probably a half dozen of the instances I know of. Councilwoman Price cited one of the more recent ones that was disappointing once the one apparel playground had been opened, I think within a matter of several days due to some adult misuse of the playground equipment that was obviously designed for children, that caused us to secure the whole area, take it out of community enjoyment, and then have some of the components re-engineered. I think that was probably probably around $50,000, I'm guessing, for the re-engineering for fortifying of the supports. And then as as you know, in CD seven, we've had some unfortunate, very significant losses of playgrounds. And again, from my perspective, I think, you know, with the best of intentions, we do want our playgrounds to be safe and welcoming for our young families and our kids to have healthy, creative play areas. And I think, you know, the kids zone in particular would be a very wise move. But I do know it's going to take a lot of coordinated effort across inter-departmental teams to make it effective. So and we'll do our part to contribute to that. But in terms of an overall dollar figure, I know Admiral Kidd playground in particular was probably going to be about half a million dollars in cost. And that's, again, the loss of access for play, too. But we've had, I know, combined park, Craftsman Village Park and just quite a number of them that have had a lot of abuse and misuse that do cost considerable amount of dollars to bring back into a safe condition. But thank you for the question. Thank you. And just to add, also, while I like to zip line, I mean, my first time ever zip line in the summer, there was a zip line at least from this part that was damaged because adults were using that line there. So I think it's very important that we protect our playgrounds and that we make sure that they ensure that children are the ones that are taking advantage of it. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Arthur. Thank you. And I want to thank Councilmember Allen for taking the lead in bringing this item forward. I think it's something that I certainly a sentiment that I share and I hope the rest of our colleagues share as well here today. I believe that playgrounds should always be a safe spaces for our children to play. And there should never, never be a deterrent for a family or child to use. Utilize the playground. Um, we should also understand that these playgrounds, particularly now, you know, we are investing in playgrounds in our city. These are public investments and we need to protect these investments, ensure that they are being utilized for the population that they are meant to. Meet. Millions have been invested in a new playground in our city. I can think of four new playground, brand new playgrounds in my district alone. Jackson Park. Marina Park. Well, there's lots of lidos where kids are now enjoying park space and enjoying time with family and looking forward to that. I was walking my dog a few weeks ago, a couple of weeks ago, and encountered a gentleman sitting on the top of a slide at one of these parks. And I encountered him and asked, What are you doing? Because I'm just hanging out. It looked like he was involved in maybe smoking or whatever. And and it struck me that this is very timely and necessary because. We know the damage has been done. And again, this individual with smoking and who knows what could have happened while he was there. I may not have I may I should probably not have engaged him. But it was okay, was a fair dialog. But it opened my eyes to the fact that we need to we need to pay closer attention to our playgrounds. And these playgrounds are designed for children and not adults. So I'm happy to support this item and look forward to something coming back with that. That can be enforced, but it's also fair. Thanks. Thank you, Councilwoman. And they have. Been nice, Mayor. And thank you, Councilwoman Allen, for bringing this item forward, along with my colleagues to sign on to this very important item. I think that the health and safety of our children has to continue to be a top priority for our city. I think this is a really great item that provides an opportunity to establish safe spaces for our children, and that really tells the family that our children continued to come first. So I'm really excited for this and for the city to be able to explore possibilities for kids throughout the city. I know that being a recipient of a playground that combined a park like Director Dennis shared was not very good. I, you know, was negatively impacted, and therefore the children were not able to use that playground. And, you know, because of all the reconstruction that needed to be done. And like Director Dennis also shared, it's not it's an expensive process. And we could be using those those funds for other things. But but I'm glad that this item is coming forward and that we really are intentionally making kids sound more friendly and welcoming to our children and our families. Thank you, Councilman Mongo. Thank you. I spent a considerable amount of time in our city's parks. My daughter's favorite park rotates. Spent a lot of time. At least three of us have spent a lot of time in Stearns Park and sent a lot of time in Eldorado Park. Spent a lot of time. I can't think of the name of it A Butterfly Park, because butterflies are my daughter's favorite. But one of the other things that I do see and I get kids on them, they're really important. And I think that it's it's critical. I think that all park equipment that is put into our city, I've seen in other cities that they say the age appropriate there. So this park equipment is intended for children under the age of 12. This park equipment is intended for participants under the weight of \u00a3225. And I think that that helps because you talk about adults and adults want to help their kids try playground equipment. And I've had a broken slide for a considerable amount of time and we have some amenities adjacent to one another that are intended for older kids and then amenities that are intended for younger kids. And occasionally when the older kids that weigh more and might be in high school or they're with their younger siblings, then they're climbing up a slide and they put their foot through it. And that's a dangerous situation all of a sudden with broken plastic. So I think that weight and age is a great tool and I see parks that have been doing that a lot in the region. I've been to Parks in Colorado and other states, and age and weight I think are really critical on all park equipment. So thank you very much. Thank you, Councilman Hooper, now. Thank you. I'd like to thank Councilmember Allen for bringing this item forward. Director Dennis did not mention it, but Rotary Centennial Park in the fourth District has had challenges for years, and this ordinance would certainly help that. But beyond protecting our existing assets, I see some potential here where with this in place we can look at properties that would not have been considered in the past, and we could build top lights in areas that might have been challenged without this ordinance. So thank you again. Thank you. I'll add my comments here. As the dad of two kids under 12, I'm happy to support kids. I think it adds a level of comfort to parent, to know that, you know, there's there's kid activity and kids in the kids own and and it makes us feel good. And, you know, I would also say that, you know, I want to make sure that we have that if you establish kids own, let's make sure the equipment inside the kids own. We're proud to let our kids play on because we still have a lot of areas where our playgrounds are just not in great shape. And so, in general, happy to support this item on any public comment on this. Okay. No matter. Motion is carried. Thank you. Two more requests to move up items.

{"input": "Hi, Madam Secretary. Please close the voting and announce the results. 3913 Ayes Council Bill 965 has passed. Council members say to Barca, will you please put Council Bill 983 on the floor for passage? Yes, Madam President, I move that council bill 20 dash zero 983 be placed upon final consideration and do pass. Humans have been moved and seconded by Councilman Herndon, the third public hearing for Council Bill 20 dash 0983 is open now we have the staff report please. And I believe we had Fran cued up for this one. Friend you might need to unmute. I'm sorry. I. Of course, honey. You're good. You're good. Okay. Let me share my screen. 1/2. I have Marianne here, but it's the. Here we go. Can you see my screen there? Mm hmm. You know, this is like waiting for hours. And, of course, the computer froze. I had the other one. No worries. No worries. You're good. Go ahead. Okay. Good afternoon. Members of City Council. My name is from UNIFIL, and I'm going to I'm going to be sending you two more cases of ideas. This is very similar to what you heard, so I apologize. I'm going to sound like a record. We're looking at 1790 Humboldt Street and the applicant is asking to rezone from U.S. you see to U.S., you see one. The subject property is located in Port Cashman's Council District six in the university neighborhood. The subject properties locate the subject. Property is at the corner of East Colorado Avenue and South Humbled Street, just southwest from I-25 and the University of Denver Light Rail Station. The subject sold is 9360 square feet, and the applicant is proposing to rezone the property from U.S., U.S. to U.S. U.S. one, which allows for the Urban House and iTouch accessory dwelling unit building for its minimum standard of 5500 square feet. The property is currently in the urban single unit, seasonal district and as you can see on the map, is mostly surrounded by other properties that are also shown us, you see. But you can see that there is a little bit of us, you b to the east. The site is currently occupied by a single unit home and is surrounded by mostly by other single unit uses. This like here shows existing context with the site of the proposed rezoning on the top left and on the top right and bottom left. Some images to show the residential character of the neighborhood. Now looking at the process. Information on notice of the application was sent on June 11, 2020. Planning Board recommended approval on September 16 and of present to letters of support from the public have been received and one letter of opposition from an R.A.. The Denver zoning code has fiber five criteria. Well, which I'll go over now. The first criteria is consistency with adopted plans. There are three plans applicable to this rezoning. We have a comprehensive plan 2040 Blueprint Denver and Housing an inclusive Denver. The rezoning is consistent with several of the strategies sought in comprehensive plan 2040. This MAP amendment will promote equity by creating a greater mix of housing options in every neighborhood, and it will lead to an environmentally resilient Denver by creating by promoting infill development where infrastructure and services are already in place. Now looking at Blueprint Denver the subject properties map is part of the urban neighborhood context. This context is described as containing small multi-unit, residential and mixed use areas that are typically embedded in one unit and two unit residential areas. Look, patterns are generally irregular with a mix of early access, and they have been described as having a high degree of walkability, likability and good access to transit with less reliance on cars. If you took place. This map designates the subject property as no residential place type. Displaced types have predominantly single and two unit uses, and accessory dwelling units are appropriate. Humble Street is designated as a local street, which is mostly characterized by residential uses. Now the growth area in Denver is all other areas of the city. This area is anticipated to see 10% employment growth and 20% housing growth by 2040. Lupine also includes specific policy recommendations. Housing policy number four talks about diversifying health choice through the expansion of accessory dwelling units throughout all residential areas. A citywide approach to enable you to use preferred until a holistic approach is in place. Individual rezonings to enable you to use in all residential areas, specifically where close to transit are appropriate. In this case, the requested rezoning is a single lot in a residential area within a few blocks from a light rail station. This rezoning 22 use district will have minimal impacts on the surrounding neighborhood and is consistent with blueprint recommendations. Adopted in 2018. Housing and inclusive. Denver was not adopted as supplemental to Denver Comprehensive Plan 2040, but was still adopted by City Council and can be relevant to the review criteria for this MAP amendment. The plan encourages expanding the development of accessory dwelling units to incentivize affordable and mixed use housing. The proposed rezoning is consistent with recommendations in a comprehensive plan. Blueprint Denver and housing in Denver because it will expand housing options and allow the development of an accessory dwelling unit. Study also finds that the proposed rezoning to U.S. U.S. one meets the next two criteria. It will result in the uniform application of some district building for use and design regulations. And the proposed official MAP Amendment furthers the public health, safety and general welfare of the city through implementation of the City Adopted Land Use Plan, which recommends the expansion of accessory dwelling units throughout all residential areas. The proposed rezoning would also provide the benefit of an additional housing unit that is comparatively integrated into the surrounding neighborhood. Stuff does find that there is a justifying circumstance for this MAP amendment, with the newly adopted vision for accessory dwelling units in all residential areas, including Denver. And finally, criteria number five. The proposed zoning is consistent with the urban neighborhood context residential district and the USOC wants on district. Stuff does recommend approval based on finding all review criteria has been met. And that concludes stuff. Presentation. Thank you, Fran. Council has not received any written testimony on Council Bill 20 20983 and we have one individual signed up to speak this evening. We have Jesse Paris. The Council dog watching at home when I was just in Paris and I didn't experience 20, 23 and I didn't Blackstar actually did the self defense housing action plan for social change. I won't be doing any part of Colorado in my own piles. I'm going to be again. Yes, I'm. I did have some questions. The first question was how many 80 requests have been approved in District six? And if you can release the demographics, the racial demographics of the occupation, appreciate it. You got this Cashman. It's going to be a reluctant. The women will look that yes for me. But you've got to make this to get past. No problem. Thank you. And cue the music. That concludes our speakers questions from members of Council. Councilman Cashman. Thank you, Madam President. Is the property owner on the line? You should be. His name is Nate Crumby. Yeah, I think we're. All right. We should be moving Nathan to the panelists. Are you there, Nate? Nate. You might have to meet yourself. I'm here. Can you hear me? Yes. And Nate? Nate, can you tell me a little bit what what what your plans are for the property where you plan on building what the access to the idea would be? So what I plan on doing is demolishing the current garage structure and then rebuilding something that's larger just to fit the city codes for building something like that and then building a putting an apartment above the garage. And currently the access to the structure, at least from. For the garage. I'm on a corner lot, so the access to the garage is from Colorado Avenue and then access to the structure is TBD. I haven't really gone through any sort of specific planning with an architect yet. Sure. And can you tell me what, as you're sitting here today, what your thoughts are for the use of this structure? Yeah. So I live close to the university and I also live close, really close to public transportation. The thought was to rent it out and provide additional income for us and, you know, just increase the foot traffic in the area. I mean, one of the great things about this neighborhood is just how pedestrian friendly it is. And, you know, the more the merrier, in my opinion. I know that the opposition, at least the R.A., had referenced parking. You know, another perspective for us is we'll actually park our cars in the garage once we had a larger structure because our garage isn't all that big right now. And so it would actually free up parking on the on the street and then also provide, you know, lower sort of cheaper option for somebody to live within the Denver city limits. Sure. Thank you. Hey, friend. Remind me what the parking requirements are for a place. If you give me a second, I can look it up very quick in my code. Apologize ahead. It all open in my other computer, of course. Take your time. So it here. And I would just mention for our friend Mr. Paris, while you're looking that up, that there are very few ADA requests thus far in District six. I don't have the exact number, but they are starting to come in. Slowly but surely. And while I understand the the desire for a citywide policy for neighborhoods that are a little antsy about this new land use, I like the fact that they're coming in slowly, and I expect to find that they're good neighbors. So we don't have any parking requirements in this you but we have the parking bays so not with. Let's go to space. Okay. So two to. Spaces off street. Parking and drive lot coverage in primary street setbacks to spaces. Okay, very fine. And the owner expects to have two spaces in the new garage, correct? Yes. Okay. Well, those are my only questions. Thank you, Madam President. All right. Thank you, Councilman Cashman. Councilman Flynn. Thank you, Madam President. Friend Same sort of question I had on the prior one, and that is as I look at the property and I didn't see in the staff report. Exactly. Of course, then you wouldn't until site development. The setbacks. It looks to me like the garage that's there already might not be within the required setback, which is 12 feet off the alley when there is an alley. And it looks to me like it's right on right on the alley right now. So when this is rebuilt, is there sufficient spare space between the primary residence and the the footprint that you would build on? And maybe the applicant could address that as well? And it seems to me it would have to be a new structure, would have to be 12 feet off the alley right of way. And that's one thing I wanted to note. So kind of like a new thing that we're doing now with the few applications that we're getting because we get so many is that at the time of the pre-application, we asked the applicants to have a meeting with development services. And that meeting basically we tell them this there's no need for them to hire an architect or have proper drawings, but they can have just like a drawing in a napkin. So exactly for what you're asking. So because we don't want anyone to reason and then find out they can build whatever they need. So we go process. It's required by code and it's not not everyone has to do it. But but we always side by side because then we don't want people to waste $1,000 and the rezoning and figure out, okay. So this has been through that and we're okay on that score. I would like to take that with me, but I think so because we get it. So like I think that maybe if you can answer that need. Yeah, sure. So I have not gone through that process and if it's 12 feet, then I've just wasted $1,000. And my understanding was that it was five feet. But but there is actually enough room to build add you know an 80 you. In our backyard. The question then is just whether or not we actually do it. But and so. Yeah. Okay. Rear setback, Ali, 12 feet on the in the staff report. All right. Thank you. That's all I have. Madam President. All right. Thank you, Councilman Flynn. Seeing no other comments or excuse me, no other questions by members of council. The public hearing for Council Bill 20 dash 0983 is closed. Comments by members of Council. Councilman Cashman Thank you, Madam President. I am an unabashed fan of ideas. I'm glad to see them. As I said, slowly coming into the district. This is a particular particularly ideal site.

Encumbering Title to Fire Station seven and ratifying and confirming certain prior acts. The Committee recommends the Council bill pass. Thank you, Councilmember Licata. This is legislation that resulted in converting some parking space in front of the old fire station seven on Capitol Hill on 15th Avenue east into basically a mini park, an open area. And we were able to do that by the city, allowing for easement of public access. In exchange, we dropped some of the covenants around the property that were no longer relevant. We did retain three important ones. The building and site improvements should not be altered in exterior appearance or from the original exterior configuration. In other words, we're not going to go back to a parking space. We'll keep it an open public space the second that the building and say improvements may be maintained in good and sound state of repair. We want to make sure that's maintained. And third, the grantee shall maintain, repair, repaint and refurbish the building as necessary to comply with the second condition, as well as making sure that everything is is as functioning in the building as well. So this is a great tradeoff. The community has gained some open space. We've allowed the people in the building to assure that they'll maintain that space as well as the building was a historic building. Thank you. Thank you. Questions or comments? Councilmember Rasmussen. Thank you. I see Councilmember Licata in the fiscal note. There's reference to a historic preservation deed. Would you describe that, please? Is this landmarked? I believe it is red marked. It's been a historic building for a long time. I think it was decommissioned as a fire station maybe as long ago as the early sixties or so. I know I moved to Capitol Hill in the early seventies and by that time it had been already converted to a community use. It looks landmarked. I was wondering whether that had been formalized. I.

Well, if I could just make a quick comment to clarify something that happened during public comment on the resolution regarding their use of youth detention. Someone commented that they appreciated how quickly that passed, and I just want to clarify that we just passed to refer it on to the Public Safety Committee meeting Wednesday at 2:00. So it hasn't actually passed out yet. There will be discussion and debate there. Thank you for the clarification. Councilmember Swan. Thank you, President Burgess. I want to thank you all who came today, especially members from the Seattle Education Association, those who spoke at public comment. I especially appreciate your presence here because I know that your more important work is to be on the picket lines and to be discussing with your fellow members. So it's your presence here is, you know, really noted. And I'm sure many of you haven't slept well in many nights over the past decade, as we've seen, public education has come under a ferocious assault by successive Republican and Democratic administrations across the country. We've seen schools being deeply underfunded and forced to teach more and more to standardized testing. There have been attempts to dismantle public education, first with vouchers and now with charter schools. And education unions have been attacked with anti-union legislation and court battles here in Washington state. We know the Supreme Court has deemed the legislature to be criminally underfunding public education in this context. The strike of our Seattle educators to fight for this cause Seattle deserves is truly historic pay, and ours for educators is absolutely vital. Outrageously, the district wants to extend the workday for teachers by 30 minutes per day without paying teachers for this. And we have to note, this is also a women's rights issue in the face of gender persistent gender inequality, gender pay disparity, because this is a profession that is that has majority women educators. Unfortunately, though not surprising, the stories that have been real of buy lose distortions by the Seattle Times on your demand on pay. But what's heartening is to see that the community is clearly, clearly rejecting those lies and is on your side unambiguously. But in addition to your own pay and hours, you're also fighting to stop those serious racial biases that persist in school discipline. You're fighting to limit the overreliance on high stakes testing. Even equity in recess time for elementary school students in different schools is something the union has had to fight for. And you won a significant victory in the face in the form of a minimum 30 minute recess. You're also fighting for caseload caps, for special education so that students can get the support that they need. If the union wins on these demands. It will be a huge step forward. A victory for students and educators that make up Seattle Public Schools. However, a victory for the union will also be a victory for education around the country because it will show that if we organize and remain united, we can resist the attacks against public education. It will also be a victory for all workers in Seattle who will be emboldened to organize in unions and campaign to have a say in their workplaces. This resolution gives the Council support for the work that all educators do. And. I wanted to congratulate President Jonathan Knapp of the Seattle Education Association, your negotiating team that has worked so hard over months, led by Phyllis Component, the vice president of the union, and all the members of your union who have stood strong not only for teachers, but for public education. I really commend you. And I also wanted to thank all my colleagues for all the involvement, the advice you provided and for supporting the resolution. Lastly, I wanted to say this. There is a crisis in funding for public education, but the solution to that is not to shortchange teachers unions, but for the school board to concede on these reasonable demands and fight with the union for full funding of public public education throughout the state. And really, one of the best ways to help end the school to prison pipeline is to fully fund public schools and give the educators a fair contract. I do want. To mention that I have donated $500 to the Seattle Education Association Strike Fund. I will be donating another $500, and I would urge all my colleagues to also do the same so that we have a real show of support for your you know, for your action. Right. Any comments or questions. All those in favor of adopting. Excuse me. I was going to say something. Councilmember Help! Please make it short and sweet. I want to correct the record since we're correcting record on the Garfield situation. I met my mother and father went to Garfield, too. I wouldn't be alive if it weren't for Garfield, by the way. So Bruce got a little deeper than my older son graduate from Garfield. Thank you for this fight. I support this legislation almost, I would say unconditionally. You're showing leadership to these children. Last weekend, I had an opportunity to to go in the locker room of some of your students before what they call the Memorial Classic. And these are students that I don't know if it's good or bad for them. They have to practice on their teams, but they're not in school. And so it's a weird dynamic here. And I just briefly talked to them on the sidelines about what they're going through. They are the most important and they are behind you so strongly. I was I was I was pleasantly surprised by that. And I think many of, you know, my my daughter graduated from Cleveland High School last year, and I testified in front of the school district several times as a PTSA representative. And I was very angry, too, at a few things. So I say this to say that it is just simply my honor to support you. You are doing this critical work with passion, with commitment. You went to school for the noble cause to help others, and I don't think there is anything any stronger than that. So thank you. And so let's make a lot of noise. Let's end this strike. Let's protect your rights. Let's win. Thank you very much. As long as we're giving our Garfield credentials. My older brother graduated from Garfield. More importantly, all three of my daughters graduated from Garfield. So we really appreciate where Garfield Garfield does. And to echo what Councilmember Harrell said, I think the people of Seattle understand the importance of education. We see that repeatedly when the district's levies pass. We saw it last November when the preschool measure passed overwhelmingly. We want to invest in the future of our children, and we do that with them and with you to make sure that they receive the the education that they deserve so that every one of them has a strong and fair start as they pursue their education in their life. All those in favor of adopting Resolution 31615 indicate by voting I. I opposed vote no. The resolution is unanimously adopted. So what do we do? Thank you. Thank you. The council will adjourn in a moment and then we will reconvene. Right. So we're just going to repeat one little element here. If the clerk would read the title of the resolution, please. Okay. We're done with that part of the title. Yeah, we're done with the resolution. So now we're going to do this. So at this point, we are going to do a little special business. Ready actually that our guest. This will be interesting. At this time the council will consider other business. And I would ask the clerk to read into the record the findings of the Public Employment Relations Committee decision. Notice to employees. State law gives you the right to form, join or assist an employee organization union bargain collectively with your employer throughout a union chosen by a majority of employees. Refrain from any or all of these activities, except you may be required to make payments to a union or charity under a lawful union security provision. The Washington State Public Employment Relations Commission conducted a legal proceeding and ruled that the city of Seattle committed an unfair labor practice and ordered us to post this notice to employees. We unlawfully changed represented employees working conditions by charging an employee with a violation of the code of ethics and initiating charges at the Seattle Ethics and Elections Commission. S.E.C. After we had previously disciplined the employee for the same misconduct to remedy our unfair labor practices, we will close the SCC investigation of Ron Allen's October 2010 misconduct. We will notify IBEW Local 77 and Allen in writing of the date that the case is closed, we will follow the disciplinary process in the collective bargaining agreement . We will notify the union of proposed changes to working conditions and bargain upon request. We will not unilaterally change represented employees working conditions or implement proposals that have not been bargained to agreement or impasse. We will not in any other manner interfere with restrain or coerce our employees in the exercise of their collective bargaining rights under the laws of the State of Washington. Thank you. We've satisfied the notice requirement. At 10 minutes to three, the Council will reconvene as the Select Committee on the Central Waterfront and we are adjourned.", "result": "AN ORDINANCE authorizing the acceptance of the grant of an easement for public access over and across a portion of the property commonly known as (old) Fire Station Seven, located at 402 15th Avenue East, in exchange for the City\u2019s extinguishment of certain deed restrictions encumbering title to Fire Station Seven; and ratifying and confirming certain prior acts."}

Councilwoman Kennedy has called out Council Bill 1421 for a comment under Bill's for final consideration. No items have been called out and under pending. No items have been called out. Looks like we didn't miss anything. So, Madam Secretary, please put the first item on our screens. And Councilwoman Black. Will you please put Council Resolution 1528 on the floor? I move that council resolution. 18 dash 1528 be adopted. It has been. Move. And seconded questions or comments by members of Council Council one Ortega. Thank you, Mr. President. I am on the board of a nonprofit that partners with Northeast Denver housing in administering the trauma program, which is our rental assistance program. So I will be abstaining from tonight's vote. Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. See no other comments or questions, Madam Secretary, roll call. Oh, Councilwoman candidate, did you want to get in there before we. Thank you. Mr. President, I had debated calling this out just for a comment, but since it's called out for a vote, I just think this is a really important program to highlight. So we in the city have had several rental assistance programs in the past, all with federal funding and all for the lowest income families. And the rules to qualify were so restrictive that it was very difficult for folks to use. And so when we created the Permanent Housing Fund in 2016, the council talked a lot with the department about the importance of creating a more nimble rental assistance program that could really help people when they were experiencing, for example, a rent increase where they would have to move, but they needed a little time or maybe they had one time emergencies. And so I just want to say that this program has now helped just over a thousand people. I believe in the time it's been in effect, and it has been extraordinarily impactful. We thought for some families we need it for five and six months. It turned out many only needed one or two months to get through a crisis and be able to stabilize. Whether that was stabilizing where they were or stabilizing until they could get a new place. And so, you know, these are kind of routine contracts, but one of the things we always hear in our community is people do not know about the programs that we have in place. So I just wanted to take a minute to talk about if you need help with rental assistance in Denver, you can call three one, one and three one. One will get you to the right person to to apply for a temporary rental assistance. And this is not just for the poorest families in our city. It includes moderate income folks, you know, up to, you know, folks that may be preschool teachers or working in retail or working in kitchens. So it is for regular folks who are struggling with their rent. We we know about how difficult the housing crisis is. We just heard testimony during our public comments about it. So I'm excited to support this bill and just make sure that we keep talking about it with our residents so they know that it's out there. Thank you. Thank you. Councilwoman, can each. Councilman Brooks? Yep. I'm just putting another point, a fine point on my colleague, Councilman Canete and Councilman Kenny's. Thank you for explaining the details of it. But I want to be very explicit and say that we are hearing all over Denver that folks want help now. They want help when they're in their housing crisis. And this exact bill does that. This helps people in and in some of the mosques. And I appreciate you, Councilman Kenneth, for saying a thousand folks. You know, it's affecting people. When people begin calling your office and tell you how it has allowed them to stay in their homes and stay competitive in their jobs as well. And so I just want to I want to thank the council for approving this. I want to thank the administration for allowing us to be nimble and help for these folks that are struggling from month to month to stay in their homes and be competitive in our city because people want to be in our city. And so thank you so much, members of council, for making this a priority. Thank you, Councilman Brooks. Councilman Lopez. I just wanted to call out a. A bill when you get the chance. Okay.

It was with great pleasure. I'd like to make the motion to our second city managers to. Q and if we can, Mr. West, you and I talk today. Apparently, we've had a problem over there with some thievery of copper wire. And so I'm hoping that there can be some budgeting for some security because there's obviously remaining facilities we don't want vandalized because it's a very important structure. And I want to thank the city manager and city staff. This has been a long, long process, but I think it's one that's going to serve the city of Long Beach very well. It's going to save the city tremendous amount of money because we are going to have an east side police station where we don't have to pay rent. And I think it's going to be a valuable asset for the community. I want to thank again Mr. Andrews and others who worked on helping resolve the facilitation of the requirement that the Federal Government put on us in terms of accommodating homeless services programs in the city of Long Beach. And so again, I would ask for support of this motion. The motion. And second, Mr. Andrews. And I also really, you know what the community engagement in education, bringing people together.

{"input": "I think motion passes or do zero item nine be and we do have four speakers. We have two speakers with two other individuals ceding time to one of the speakers and this is a referral to consider the adoption and resolution condemning the increased incidence of bias, prejudice, discrimination, violence and antisemitism, and to direct staff to provide a status update on hate crime training and possible training of community members, and to direct the city manager to provide periodic reports to Council on Hate Crimes. This referral was brought by myself and Councilmember Ody. Councilman Brody, do you want to? So I think on the face of it, it pretty much explains what it is. We all witnessed some of these horrible activities happening here in Alameda with the the temple. Temple is real. And then the hate fliers and the vice mayor and I. I don't if I speak out of turn, you can correct me. I mean, we thought it was important that we take the stand and we actually call out, you know, these groups and this hate for what it is and name them by names. Some people accuse me of being too emotional sometimes up here in this. This may be one of those times when that happens. But, you know, this this type of stuff, you know, there's no place for this in Alameda. And I see the family here in the audience. And, you know, I was told that, you know, there's a list of these hate incidents in high schools and we're on their way too many times. It's like five or six times. And, you know, this stuff, I mean, it has to stop. Okay. And I think as a council, we need to put a firm foot down. And I'm sure, you know, I hope and I'm sure that we're going to get a lot of support on the council for this. But, you know, folks, this is not the place for this. And, you know, our town is much better than this. So I hope that, you know, we can be unanimous in this. And I appreciate the mayor, you know, adding her extra points to this based on the. I'm sorry. I forgot the name of the group. See, I'm already the mayor's. The Mayor's compact, so, I mean, that's basically the gist of it. And I don't know Vice Mayor, if you want to add more, but. So I just want to also say that, you know, at Temple Israel, I did speak with one of the students that was a victim of one of these hate crimes in the schools. I, you know, want to give credit to her for speaking up and for being vocal. It takes a tremendous amount of courage to do so. And I just want to say that I recognize that and I see your strength and I see you. And I think that in many ways there have been other cities that have taken actions to specifically call out acts of antisemitism, to specifically call out acts of hate. You know, we also had a noose that was found on our high school campus this first day of school. There are things happening in our own community here, not just nationally. And so we really do need to respond to it and to unequivocally say that hate does not belong here in our city, that we do not condone it, that it is not our brand and it is not who we are. I do want to make a couple of clarifying clarifications in our in our actual resolution. We we mention a few different regional issues and some other some other things that are happening. I do want to make clear that, you know, it's not just neo-Nazi ism, it's just pure Nazi ism, and that this isn't something that is come out of nowhere. That there has been, you know, continuous targeting of certain groups. And, you know, whether it's individuals that are of Jewish, ethnic or religious ancestry. And I think that it's, you know, or people that are being identified because of their skin color. And I really want to make it clear that we are taking a stand against that, that this is not something new, that just because these incidents have surfaced in our community as of late, it does not mean that they haven't been latent. And so I do want to make those clarifications regarding the statements, because we mentioned in recent years nationwide and in the Bay Area, but it's been going on for generations. So I'd be amenable to removing the in recent years portion of the. The first paragraph of whereas where it says in recent years nationwide and in the Bay Area I would just strike the in recent years portion of that the. Other the other statement that I wanted to make is, you know, our police department has, you know, very been very clear that they are investigating the incident at Temple Israel as a potential hate crime, as a hate crime. And they are looking for additional evidence. My understanding is that our updating policy there, you know, they are noticing us. I've seen the emails recently with regards to all the incidents in terms of getting the council notification. So I do want to make that very clear to the public that we are getting this and the direction is really reflective of what our current policy is. And so making sure that we're actually following through with what our existing policy is. So with that, I want to call up our first speaker. Jessica Lindsay. And her parents, Mel Waldorf and. Oh, sorry. Natasha waldorf is the speaker and jessica lindsay and mel waldorf have ceded their time to her. Hello. My name is Natasha Waldorf. Members of the City Council. Thank you for considering this resolution condemning incidents of bias, prejudice, discrimination, violence and antisemitism. The resolution is an important step, but I'm here to ask you to do whatever you can to make sure that students like me are protected from anti-Semitism in our schools. I've lived in Alameda my whole life and attended Alameda Public Schools in second grade. For the most part, my school experience has been good. However, last year was threatened multiple times because I am Jewish to the point that I felt unwelcome and actually afraid for my safety in the middle of a class. Last January, I received a text from an unknown number with a picture of Mr. Clean dressed in a Nazi Nazi uniform labeled Mr. Ethnic Cleansing. I thought, this must be a mistake, or perhaps a bad joke. So I replied with a random picture. Then I received a text containing a picture of a Nazi with the words Horns, get the gas. I quickly realized that whoever was sending these text was not joking around. I was called a kike. I was told Hitler's biggest mistake was not killing my family. And then I should apologize to all Germans. The text referred to me by name. Whoever was doing this knew who I am, but I didn't know who was threatening me. I was scared. I told my parents and went to the police who said we should work with the school administration. The next day, I learned that a German exchange student I knew from one of my classes had instigated the texts. I confronted him about it and his response was that I should just stop being Jewish if I didn't like it and that people don't like Jews because of that little country of yours, meaning Israel. He also questioned whether Jews have really been persecuted throughout history. Two days later, I was waiting for a class to start with a Jewish friend of mine when we overheard two boys making Holocaust jokes. We asked them to stop and they immediately replied that they wished our families had been thrown in the ovens. After the first incident, my parents went to see the school administration who took the stance that these anti-Semitic threats were simply rude comments and definitely not hate crimes. Then they tried to dismiss the German student's behavior, saying it must have been due to a language barrier, even though the student had no trouble expressing his hatred in English . When the third incident happened, they again took these as just bad words. My parents talk with the dean and the vice principal, but they clearly didn't understand how hateful, threatening and frightening these incidents were. Telling a Jew that her family should have been killed in the Holocaust is like telling a black student her whole family should have been lynched. It's a very clear threat and I can tell you it instills very real fear. The administration says they disciplined the students. But all I know is that I didn't even get apologies from the German student or the two students who threatened me and my friend. Despite promises from the administration that I would, I was not asked to fill out a bullying report, even though I was asked to complete one when I witnessed one student push another. No report means no record of these incidents whatsoever. We're still I had to sit with these bullies in the same classes for the remaining five months of the school year, sometimes with them sitting directly next to me. Not only was seeing them daily difficult, it was clear from the behavior they believe they had one. In one of my classes, the same kids were telling Holocaust jokes right in front of a teacher who said and did nothing in response. Later in the year, I found a drawing on a desk with the words Jews are evil, along with the star of David holding a money bag about to be crushed by a sledge hammer with a swastika on it. At the end of the year. The Jewish Club, which I'm a part of, put up posters for the Jewish American History Month. They were all ripped down. Within three days, I informed the dean, who said it was probably just a mistake by students from the leadership class clearing old posters. The Dean never even considered that the incident might be anti-Semitic vandalism and should be investigated. My parents tried to help me immediately after I started in January. They spoke repeatedly with the school administration and the superintendent and made constructive suggestions. It didn't make a difference. The superintendent defended all actions taken and told us that all incidences were handled appropriately. Appropriately. How? Why didn't the school officials require the police to apologize to me and acknowledge that what they'd done was hurtful and wrong? Why was I forced to endure classes every day with these bullies sitting right next to me? Why wasn't the superintendent concerned enough about what was happening to let families know that anti-Semitism was a problem in our high school? And to make it clear it would not be tolerated? Why didn't the superintendent show any concern about me feeling safe and welcome at school, especially at a school claiming that everyone belongs here? As if this isn't all bad enough. This past Tuesday, I went with my parents to the Board of Education meeting. The board was considering a resolution like this one denouncing bullying, including anti-Semitism. My father wrote a statement because I wasn't comfortable enough to do it myself. He told the board about my experiences and how the superintendent knew about all this since last January and did nothing. After my father finished talking to teachers, immediately got up to defend the superintendent, saying he's a wonderful leader and how good he has been for teachers. They also took the opportunity to falsely accuse my family of being unwilling to work with the district. They actually claimed that my story was purposeful manipulation. These two teachers were essentially telling me that I don't matter to the district and that I am a liar. The superintendent who had just been talking about how much he cares about students, watched me get bullied by two of his teachers and did nothing. I was so upset and felt so betrayed by people who are supposed to care about me that I had to leave the room and barely managed to hold back my tears until I was outside. What kind of district is this? What kind of teachers demean and bully a student who's already endured, endured threats and bullying from her classmates? What kind of superintendent can claim he will not tolerate bullying of any sort and that he wants to make right what has been wrong and then sit by and watch me be victimized again right in front of his face. anti-Semitism is a serious problem in our schools. I'm not the only victim. I'm just the only one willing to stand up and fight. Members of the City Council, I hope you'll stand up to please do whatever you can to make sure the district makes the necessary changes in its policies and practices so that the district can honestly say everyone belongs here. Thank you. Our next speaker is Brian Schwartz. Thank you. Thank you. Vice Mayor and council member Odie and. My name is Brian Schwartz, and I'm a civil rights lawyer. I live here in Alameda. I'm ashamed. To be in a place where Natasha's having the experiences that she's having. I'm a Bay Area native, and I moved here with my family to Alameda. Well, actually, I didn't have kids at the time. We moved here because we thought that even though we could live anywhere in the world, literally anywhere, we chose this place because of its diversity here, not just because of the weather or the beach or the lively restaurant scene or any of those things. I moved here because this was the kind of community that I wanted my kids to grow up in because because it's a kind of community where unlike Lafayette or Orinda or Piedmont or San Francisco or Marin County or the peninsula here in Alameda there there really are all kinds of people. There are all kinds of people. Income wise, there all kinds of people, race, ethnicity, all living together. And I thought harmoniously and to some degree, that promise has been true. My daughter's best friend in school is African-American, and my son's best friend is Vietnamese-American and, you know, many other stories like that. But I never imagined that in moving to this place that that as a Jewish person in Alameda, that my children would not be safe. And it's not just a brick through the synagogue window, and it's not just Natasha. I've seen the places in Poland where Nazis murdered millions of Jewish people. And. It does start with things like this. My eight year old daughter last last year when she was eight was told by another eight year old student that she should have died with the rest of the Jews in gas chambers. We've seen hate against Muslims, against African-Americans. So yes, we have to pass this resolution, but. That. Is not enough. We have to say that there's this is no place for hate, but that's not enough either. We can't just say that we have to do something about it. I'm committed to helping. As a civil rights lawyer, as a citizen of this community, to helping however I can to start building the fabric that we need to build with all of these brilliant strands that we have here in this city. But we have to say yes. Free speech exists, but no hate is not consistent with our shared values. And we won't tolerate it. And. Well, I'm excited to see what we do next. Thank you. Do we have any council discussion? Councilor mutter I it's that's appalling. This resolution has to pass tonight. I'm okay with the edit that you proposed. I think that's the first example that we have to show. I think the next is up to city management from a city side to look at the tenants and the resolution and present to us at whatever occasions that they're there are including the city manager's report on steps that we're taking to fulfill. The direction that's given in this resolution. And then I do know that we have a liaison committee between the assumed and the city council. And I think that would be a vehicle to. Formulate the next steps. I don't think we can do it here tonight. The next steps that Mr. Schwartz references with, I understand, to members of the school board, two members of the council superintendent and the city manager, and come back to the body with anything that can be coming out of that discussion. And I don't think this is a one time deal. This resolution is meant to be durable and. Vigilance is going to be required and we have to act quickly when things do happen. Yes. Thank you, Councilmember Councilmember Ashcraft. Thank you. And Vice Mayor Violet. So, Jessica Lindsey, mother of Natasha, and I served on the Economic Development Commission together a long time ago. And I knew her when she was, well, just a baby. And she certainly became a beautiful young lady. And it is appalling the story you told. We are the city, so we're a separate entity from the school district. But as a councilmember matter, S.E. noted, there is a liaison committee and I sit on it between the city and the school district. The mayor is the other member. And I mean, just the thoughts that were running through my mind were if this was and I realize it was more than one student, but if there was an exchange student involved, is it I mean, when I was going to Alameda High a long time ago, I was American Field Service. I don't know if, you know, what group sponsors an exchange. And I would think at the very least, they should be made aware of these actions. But this is just what I think. And sometimes even after the fact, you can do things. But I do agree that this is something that should be added to our agenda for our next mayor. I can't remember. I think it's next month, isn't it? October 10th we are meeting. And so I just. It's appalling. And to me it's just so sad because I want to think that we've made more progress. And in a lot of ways I think we have. But you can't let your guard down. And an education is so important. I and I know I should say that. Brian Schwartz I would also like to introduce you to my very eloquent appointee to the Open Government Committee, because my previous appointee moved out of Alameda to Davis with her family. And I asked Brian if he would would fill that role because I knew he would be a bright, capable and eloquent voice. So I'm very glad I wanted to get you more involved in the city. And it sounds like we're going to find ways to get you more involved still. But and I know your wife and Alicia had told me that story about your daughter, and it was eight years old. It's just. Anyway, yes. Passed the resolution and then hopefully this sort of thing will generate the kinds of discussions we need to have at. Schools. And religious institutions and community gathering. But we need to talk about it. And this is a first step. So just remember. Think. Thank you. And I kind of echo a lot of what my council or fellow colleagues said. And that was really brave. And Natasha left the room. I can understand why, but please. Ella was very brave. And, you know, I don't want to deviate too much into social commentary here, but I think a lot of us thought, you know, back eight or nine years ago that, you know, this was a different country. Right. That we were over a lot of the evil and horrible and worst in our nature. And in the last year and a half, you know, I think a lot of us have a rude awakening that that's not true. And that not only as the vice mayor said, these attitudes, these beliefs, these people that believe them are out there, but now they feel embolden because like it or not, you know, they have a compadre in the White House that thinks it's okay to be this way. So that's why we wanted to call out, you know, specifically, you know, white nationalism, you know, Nazi ism. I'm not afraid to say it. I'm not afraid to say that this is the problem. I'm not afraid to say that these are the people whose beliefs do not align with us, and we can't dismiss it as you know . Language barrier. We can't dismiss it as kids being kids. You know, we can't just dismiss it. We have to acknowledge it. And every time something like this happens, you know, this is I'm asked. We asked for the reporting not to be punitive to anyone on staff or in the police department because they're doing an amazing job. But to make sure the public knows and is reminded that, you know, we have to fight these and the I think we fight them is with transparency. And, you know, I think. Brian. Right. I mean, I appreciate your comment that I, too, visited, you know, Auschwitz and the one next. I think it's broken out. Right. And that was just, you know, mind boggling. And I told this story before, and I'll say it again, you know, I have a branch in my family. My mother does all the genealogy, and there's one branch from Poland. A Western Poland that is just gone. She can't find records. They're not in the Catholic Church records, so perhaps they're not Catholic. So I don't know. And she did the DNA, which shows where your descends into our you know, and you could see where she's found all these people. And there's blotches of, you know, dots where where these people live that are potential relatives. But in this area, in Poznan, in western Poland, there's none. So I don't know where that branch of the family is. You know, I don't know if they were massacred by Ukrainians. I don't know if they were sent to the death camps and killed by the Nazis. I don't know that. So I mean, it is kind of a personal thing to me, you know? So. I'm sorry. I'm going to start crying, so I'm going to stop. But. Yeah. I can't. Thanks. So it's 1057, and I'm going to need to have a motion to continue that move. We finished. 11. A second. All those in. Favor. Hi. Hi. So a couple of things that I really appreciate the support that I'm hearing from my colleagues up here tonight. And there was an incredible showing. All five members of the council were at the temple in response to that incident that occurred. And so I think that that was a tremendous first step to show that we were all in sync and in line in terms of wanting to have a very clear response. Our city manager was there as well. You know, I think. This is one of these issues that you you know, when I. You don't think, okay, we're going to have to get up here and pass a resolution and address it. But what we found is that by talking about it, by having these events, more people are coming forward and to the point where we're asking for training opportunities and things like that. There's a lot of training that our police officers get, and one of the requests that we've gotten is could there be an update perhaps at the Shrub board about just the trend in terms of the different hate crimes that have happened and what the response has been and what our general protocol is, how we go about identifying these things in the in the general process, because many members of our community don't know necessarily who to call or how to report it or what a hate crime is. And I think it's a term that we're starting to hear more and more of, unfortunately. But in many ways, we also want to empower our constituents to understand and feel welcome in embracing the processes that we have laid out and that we already have. And I know that the information is available online, but perhaps it could be a topic that's covered. Yeah, we could talk to Shrub about it. There is a couple of things. I mean, I think Natasha story was shocking to the core and it does have to stop. My and the resolution and especially having a liaison meeting with the school district in the city I think is important. What I'd like to do, though, there's a difference between a hate incident and a hate crime when a hate crime has a victim. Right. A hate incident is something that you might find that isn't targeted towards an individual. Right. There is also part of some of the people who do hate incidents, this or hate crimes, they do it because of the attention. Right. And I don't want to have an unintended consequence of me giving reports of things happening in town to actually increase the number of hate incidences or hate crimes. And we have actually seen an increase recently with the Facebook posts and the media coverage on it. What I would rather talk to the council about is what we're doing about it, not about the incident itself, but what is the outcome of a USD in the City Liaison Committee? What did Shrub say? What education are we doing to minimize the unintended consequence of giving someone the additional attention that they are somehow shockingly requiring, and instead do it more about how we're going to go forward from here to make a difference? So that's my only concern about the way that the resolution or the referral was written for the second part of it. The reporting out. I take reporting out to be fairly broad. I mean, you give us updates relative to our resolution that we passed about the sanctuary city in terms of different steps that that you're taking. And I think from at least from my perspective, it's really to talk about what the city is doing to address things that have happened. And so we want to make it very clear that the city is not going to be idle and not do anything. I'm not going you know, we will have a response. We are going to investigate. This is what we're doing. This is how we're handling it, whatever might be appropriate. But I do want to make sure that that's done publicly, because I think in many ways it takes a tremendous amount of courage to speak up in the first place and to come forward. And so I want to make sure that we're not. We're not stifling. We're not. Stifling that. But also being sensitive to that. It's a good point. I think that the city manager made we and there's a there's a delicate balance, I think, to be achieved. And it's it's not to say that, you know, we did reference some of the specific incidents that have happened. And I think, you know, certainly through the liaison committee and through Shrub and even through this process of reporting out, I want to make it very clear that it's not to say that we're going to gloss over that something happened. We're going to say there was an incident. This, you know, this is what happened. This is who was targeting. We don't necessarily have to glorify the incident or give it a lot of fanfare, but we can I mean, in order to talk about what steps you're taking to address something, you inherently have to talk about the underlying issues. And there's different levels like Natasha's story is dramatic and shocking. There have been some significant incident reports that the police have started doing more of. Some of them were not previously. Mm hmm. Rose to the level. And I personally think that two roommates fighting and using language against each other should not be a significant incident report. So I would like to give that discretion back to the police. Say tell us the ones like the Temple and Natasha's story and the ones that rise to a level, rather than saying anyone who comes to the police department to complain is equal and equal to murder or. Other things, it's like. Our priority setting is these are really know the difference between a hate incident and a hate crime. And I think we need to make sure that they, as the professionals, contain and have still their discretion that they are granted by state law. And I understand that. I think my concern arises out of the fact that, for instance, with the with the Temple Israel incident, I learned about it through members of the public. And there wasn't a report sent out until. A couple of days. A couple of days later. And so I think from a counsel standpoint, we also I think there's an expectation as elected officials that we respond to certain things or at least be knowledgeable and be aware that they're happening so that we can be of assistance to our constituents. So I just want to make sure that we we do strike that balance. I think there's it's one thing when there's some sort of personal dispute between two people, and it's another thing when there's, you know, either a major action taken against a symbolic place or building or something that's, you know, something that rises above and beyond where it's very much directed at targeting an individual and the comments being made. I totally agree with that. I mean, and I think the temple incident, it was like 12 hours later. Mm hmm. And it should have been earlier and we've talked about that before, but so that going forward and that level is as soon as possible get that information out. But that's the the difference and sort of knowing that there's a range and the range. Or it's also one of those things and I've heard the comment that hate incidents, you know them when you see them sometimes they're hard to describe specifically in terms of because they can be so many different things and they can occur in so many different ways. But, you know, the courts have said that about other types of speech. And I think this is one of those things. I mean, the stories that we've heard tonight have all been very shocking, very disturbing. The other thing that I want to add is, again, the the training aspect of this and letting the public know what the routes are in terms of what they can do to report things, who they report to, what type of information matters. There's a lot of constituents. They'll see something and they're shocked by it or disturbed by it. But then they they don't know who to call or what sort of information is necessary. Like, I saw this on this day. This is what I did. Don't you know, don't get rid of it. But you have to make sure you documented and give are police officers. So how can they be of assistance in terms of reporting mechanisms, I think would be something that I've heard would be much appreciated and helpful. The other thing is the Anti-Defamation League has offered to give a presentation either at Shrub or in conjunction with the city regarding some of their best practices and the trainings that they do. And I think that if we can work with these different organizations, that would also be a nice step in terms of following this up without , you know, using the most of the resources that exist. And our police have. 98% of all our officers did a bias training that we were the first city in the region to do it right. I think in the state. So we we are on it from that perspective as far as the training of our officers. Okay, I if I could. And then so I had the first amend amendment to the resolution that I mentioned. The Second Amendment that I wanted to add was in the third paragraph where it says these acts. We heard very clearly from one of our student or Almeida Unified students tonight that those acts weren't from a white nationalist or racist group they were from. Racist individuals. But they weren't necessarily part of a coordinated group. So I would also like to amend that paragraph to just say some of these. So I would like to add some of. Our. Paragraphs. It's paragraph. Three. So whereas some of these. Whereas some of these acts appear to have. Come third, whereas. Correct. Ready for motion. I'll move approval of the item. For. As has amended by the vice mayor second. All those in favor. I. Thank you, counsel. Thank you. And so Councilmember Communications. Before we leave that, can we summarize what I'm sure maybe as the city manager to summarize immediate steps? That relate to the liaison committee just to make sure that we know what. Was going what's going to happen. And we will add to the agenda on October 10th. And actually I encourage Pasha to come. It is open to the public. What time is the meeting city manager. I mean, get it usually 4:04 p.m.. Okay. Yes, it's 4 to 5 and it's here at City Hall. And it's a and it's a public meeting. Thank you.

{"input": "Agenda Item one Council Bill 120151. Relating to the Department of Finance and Administrative Services. Authorizing the Director of the Department of Finance and Administrative Services or the Director's designee to negotiate and execute a real property lease with the Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority for vacant land at 1000 Northeast 45th Street. Seattle, Washington. And ratifying and confirming certain prior acts. Thank you. I moved to pass house 120151. Is there a second? Second? Thank you. Councilmember Lewis, it's been moved and seconded to pass the bill as co-sponsor of this bill. I'll address it first and then I'll recognize Councilor Lewis as the other co-sponsor and open it up for comments, if there are any. Colleagues, in the spirit of engaging the homelessness crisis with the urgency it deserves. Councilor Lewis and I walked on to last week's introduction of referral calendar of this Council Bill 120151. This expedited bill would authorize the city to enter into this lease with sound transit for the use of this site for a tiny home village in the University District. I want to thank Sound Transit for making this land available to us to address homelessness in the area. And thank Councilmember Lewis for enabling us to go straight to the City Council rather than through a committee. The council already authorized the funds for this tiny village during our budget approvals last November. The nonprofit Low Income Housing Institute, known as Lehigh and their volunteers have completed building these tiny homes for the University District, which I was able to visit in their factory recently. So the last step of approval is this lease so that we can get more people off the streets and into their own space and onto a positive future. The site is approximately 18,000 square feet and can fit approximately 36 tiny house structures. The lease would be for approximately two and a half years. After hosting the tiny village, the construction of new permanent affordable housing will occur on this site in our university district. To further expedite this project of our sound transit, to sign the lease today, which they have already done. We've also asked the mayor to sign the legislation within the next 24 hours, and her office has agreed. And finally, our financial administrative services director standing by, ready to sign the lease on behalf of the city government. I know the nonprofit Lehigh is eager to get started on this site so we can finally get this done and get more people who are experiencing homelessness inside. And as we discussed this morning, we're hopeful this lease can be used as a template for future partnerships not only in Seattle, but throughout the region to accelerate our response to the homelessness crisis. And now I'll go ahead and recognize Councilmember Lewis. You'd like to speak to this. Thank you, Councilman Peterson, for giving me the opportunity to weigh in on this really important bill. I do. First, I want to clarify this morning, I believe I referred to this village as the Roosevelt Village. And I did so because it is on Roosevelt, but in the university district. So I do just want to clarify if I confused anyone out in the public as to the location that it is in the university district. Speaking a little bit more broadly, I think here's just a few big points I want to make at the top. Just to emphasize, Councilmember Peterson, some of your points. We are in a dire state of emergency on chronic homelessness in the city of Seattle. We need more tiny house villages as part of, at the very least, the short term response to give more people a safe, dignified and hygienic place to live. As we work toward getting more folks into housing and as we all know, permanent supportive housing is the ultimate replacement to finally make progress in chronic homelessness. But in the meantime, we do need to wean into some of these shelter placements that have demonstrated results. We know from the past five years of our homelessness state of emergency that. Tiny house villages are one of the interventions that have scored the best on the data that we have accumulated. We know that on average people move on from a single family, sorry, from a a tiny house, a village to a placement that is permanent supportive housing or some other kind of subsidized housing after an average stay at 16 months. We know we can speed that up with other interventions like rapid rehousing and like a bigger supply of permanent supportive housing. But we also know in the meantime that people find people experiencing homelessness and with lived experience, find tiny house villages to be highly desirable interim placements. If they weren't, they would be empty. All of our tiny house villages are full right now and the folks who are living currently in unsanctioned encampments would jump at the opportunity to be in a tiny house instead of the encampment as they await an offer to go to a better place than the tiny house village. So I just wanted to make those broader points that we need to continue to do this work. I also just want to say, as I mentioned in the meeting earlier today, that this lease that you did an excellent job of running down Councilmember Peterson and working with all the stakeholders to make sure that after our vote today , quick administrative action will be taken to move this forward. Does offer a template for future collaboration with sound transit as a partner in this space. As I mentioned at a briefing today, my office has been in several meetings with sound transit over the course of the last six months. Sound Transit has generously identified and sent on to us three additional suitable sites on both sound transit with similar characteristics to this site in the University District. And we should continue to explore how this lease that we are voting on today could be a template to potentially create more tiny house villages on those sites in partnership with our Friends of Sound Transit. And with that, I have nothing else to add and look forward to voting for this. Thank you, Councilmember Lewis. Any other comments on the bill and the clerk? Please call the roll on passage of the bill. Lewis, I. Morales Yes. Macheda I saw on. Yes. Strauss Yes. Herbold Yes. Suarez I think as president. Peterson. Yes. Eight in favor. Nine opposed.

I know that just before we move on to the next item, this Mr. Ross, I, you know, just taken a glance at that. A lot of great companies on there. None I saw from Long Beach. And I'm not sure if that's. Maybe. I'm not sure. There aren't companies in Long Beach that can do that, that level of work. But I think that it's always kind of disappointing when we don't see local companies on these large, you know, these large awards.

Okay, so we're back on the item. Misspoke. Yes, sir. Thank you. So we do have vacancies in our planning, our building department, in both the plan checker and the inspection classifications. That is a reflection on the very tight job market that we have. And so we do have the ability to contract out while we're going through recruitment on those positions. We have actually had a very difficult time working with firms in actually getting any firm to be able to supply us with contract staff for those positions. And it is true that we do not have the Long Beach businesses who are able to put to supply those needs for us. So we have had to go outside the city for a number of years for those services.

This issue was brought to my attention after litigation and a decision from the Court of Appeals for the state of Washington. In this case, the Seattle Housing Authority voucher recipient requested a change in her voucher from a studio apartment to a one bedroom apartment as a disability related accommodation. In this case, FHA was not the landlord. The FHA was only the voucher administrator. The court decided, based on a plain reading of the language in the Seattle Municipal Court, in the statutory context, supporting the legislative intent to cover only the landlord tenant relationship. It did not apply to FHA in its role as a voucher administrator. The court noted in its decision that if the city wishes to and extend the unfair practice requirement to include a requirement that Section eight program administrators like FHA making a reasonable accommodation when requested, it can amend the SC accordingly. This legislation is in direct response to the case and does so does amend the settlement code to allow the city to enforce the obligation for reasonable accommodation in instances where a provider is the the the housing and the housing voucher administrator, not the actual landlord.

{"input": "The first is the 41st and Fox station area that will open in the spring of 2016, introducing new multimodal access to the area and transitioning the area to a more TOD and mixed use context, supporting higher intensity redevelopment as well. And also within the area, we've seen a number of proposed rezonings and larger redevelopment sites signaling a change in the surrounding environments to that TOD and mixed use context as it evolves over time. And finally, we find that the existing UO two zoning does not reflect the city's adopted vision as reinforced in the Globeville Neighborhood Plan adopted in 2014. Another change condition. Now on to consistency with neighborhood context. As described earlier and as well in your staff report, we find that it is appropriate to apply zoning within the Urban Center neighborhood context at the subject site, both through the adopted plan vision as well as the multimodal context that will be enhanced when the 41st and Fox station area opens in spring 2016. And then moving on to consistency with zone, district purpose and intent, the c r zone districts are intended to promote safe, active and pedestrian scale diverse areas through building forms that activate the street edge. And they also introduce small scale commercial uses along with primarily residential uses. So we do find that the rezoning of C, r X8 is at the subject site is consistent with this purpose statement. And finally, the cr8 zone district specifically applies to residentially dominated areas served by collector or arterial streets where scale of 2 to 8 storeys is desired. And as we've seen to the adopted plan vision, our subject site is located on a mixed use arterial. And plans recommend building heights of eight storeys. So we do find that the rezoning is consistent with this intent statement. So based upon CPD's review of the five criteria, we find that all the criteria have been met and accordingly recommend approval of application 2015, i.e. 00052 from IAU or two to see our x eight. And I'd be happy to answer any questions you have. And the applicant is here as well tonight. Thank you. Thank you. We have two speakers for this hearing. We have our Ahmad Payan and Mr. Sekou. Thank you. Congratulations, city council on your new appointments. And I just want to touch on a couple of quick items. I believe that the direction that the city is going in this part of the city that has been neglected for. I've been there since 1962. And it's it's been longer than that. I believe this is an area of smart growth. And I believe this is this is an area that's going to be as well as other cities in the world. I call it Smart Town. And this is the first of the beginning of very many light rail projects that will be moving forward. So again, I'd like to thank you and applaud you for allowing taking these only requests and consideration as and especially your planner, Ryan Wittenberg led outstanding staff that you have on board of the city and County of Denver Planning Office. Again, this is an area of change against smart growth and a transportation development center. Again, the reason I say smart growth is because we have a light rail station that encourages high density housing there, but to be use effectively and efficiently to use the services throughout the city, but more importantly, to make them more citizens and the residents of the city and county of Denver, more mobile and using and does not use in their cars and creating pollution in our neighborhood. Again, I just want to say thank you. And I did reach out to several neighbors upon Councilman Brooks's request. One resident neighborhood that suggested if we could get some street sweeping done over there. And finally two of the tenants are being evicted, unfortunately. And the other four didn't have very much comment. And you did receive three other comments that several other residents to respond. So, again, thank you and have a great evening. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. My name is Chairman Sekou on the. Proud founder and organizer for the Black Star Action Movement for Self-defense, representing poor, working, poor and homeless people. On the surface, this looks like to be something that needs to be happening again. This area has been disregarded as far as a place for development. And now that the city is in a boom period, all neighborhoods who traditionally were poor, working, poor, homeless, black and brown people. Are now up for grabs. If this is going to follow the other processes of how other neighborhoods have been developed over the last ten years of gentrification and relocation, and especially for poor and working poor and homeless people. This change to build housing is for who? Who? Poor people. Brown people. Black people. Homeless people? No. No, it wasn't done in five points. It's not going to be done there. So you have displacement going on. And this for the new folks is part of your tool belt. So you can help keep poor, working poor and homeless people within the city county of Denver by not being a rubber stamp for developers and the mayor's office who are under Dodge for taking money from these developers. All right. And then when these developers come in here, they don't employ no poor working, poor homeless people on this project so that we can come up in one day afford the rent. So you have designed poverty. Systematic poverty, that the biggest problem and now you have a great. Opportunity tonight because they messed up. Say it's more y'all than them on the boat. All right. Y'all can seize the upper ground now. Send a message to the people that you can't come in here. We are concerned about you. So people don't have to come in here and do what they just did, man. See? Because that can be a standard operating procedure, man, that we got to go through that. Why? Why? See? What? Doesn't make no sense, man. So to abort folks from having one of them housing rights that you had out in San Francisco. You know what I'm saying? Total disruption and madness. And then in the process of rebuilding, you could have spent the money on homeless and working people without all of that drama. Come on. Come on, man. Come on. Because the people are. Sick and tired of being sick and tired. And as their voices are muted and the dis and the demonstrations don't. You don't get it. They would have said, we have no other choice. Mr. Sanchez is. Mr. Secular. Tear down. Mr. Sekou, 3 minutes is up. Thank you very much. Thank you, sir. All right, so that. Concludes our speakers ready for questions from members of council. Councilman Brown. Yeah. Question for Armando Payan. Mr. Perry, how long have you lived in neighborhood? I've been in this neighborhood since 1963, and I like to think that gentleman that spoke. But I'm brown and I've been here and I've been here since 1963. Okay. Mr. Brown, just ask. I'ma set you up. Well, to answer all of the misconceptions that gentleman just put on there. So you've been in there since since 1906? Yes, sir. How can you answer the question? How many years you've been since 1963. Over 50 years. And what are you doing in the community right now? Right now, we have a multiple of projects going on. And just just to share with some of the council people who have been part of this process, we gave out 500 backpacks to every kid in garden place. Those kids didn't have a didn't have a backpack to go to school. We took it upon ourselves to go get those backpacks. The United Way, the Salvation Army. Not one of those organizations gave us those backpacks. Did you know what? We went and got those backpacks for those kids because you know why? I know what it's like to be poor. And this project is for poor people. It's not about. I ain't got no money. Sir, I appreciate. Appreciate your responding, but could you please just answer. This question, sir? Thank you. Thank you for what you're doing in the community. So you said that you reached out to some of the neighbors who were in here. You know, we've had we've probably had three rezonings in this neighborhood within the last couple of months. And so just concern that some of the folks who are in the neighborhood don't really understand the transition that's going on. And so just tell me about some of the conversations you've had with some of them. Well, again, I've been down there and just reached out to some of the residents that are down there. And I know because I've been down there myself and they welcome the change in terms of the positive things that it brings to our neighborhood, things that we don't have no grocery stores down there. We got marijuana dispensary stores down there. We ain't got a grocery store, but thank God that's when there's one coming down the line. So before now, that's going to happen. And one of the a couple of the residents have already alluded to that these are some basic services that are going to happen that haven't been there before . We're going to get a clinic. They have some medical services there. We're going to get a grocery store. We're going to get some banking because right now, you know what, it cost $3 to go to 7-Eleven and do a transaction. You know why? Because we we don't have a bank down there to do branch banking. They take advantage of us and exploit us. But that's all going to change for the better. And we'll have jobs. I can guarantee you that. So, again, I want to thank city council because I believe this is smart growth and this is going to help everybody. You're right. There are neighborhoods been neglected for over a hundred years, but that's going to change right now for the positive thing. And my belief is I'm still there to help that change move forward and we don't get left behind in the process. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Okay. Thank you, Councilman Brooks. Councilwoman Ortega, you're up. Mr. Ryan, if you can just stay there for a second. Sure. Can you tell us generally about how many residential units you expect to put into the development? Maybe just a handful. Depends on the cost. And, you know, my goal is to, again, help provide some of the services that this neighborhood has been neglecting for for the past several years. What would make those affordable housing? And I really mean I know what it is to be poor. You know, I'm not I'm not I mean, for me, this is something that to help the community. To answer your question directly. I'm hoping to get 6 to 8 units in there. What the composition of those I don't really don't know because I don't have the cost. I've been looking at some costs and obviously they're skyrocketed. But I'm hoping and work with Denver Housing, Section eight housing to be able to afford some some some nice units to some individuals such as our in this room today. Well that's that's a lot foresight. And Debbie Ortega, for the record, was at the school that was that guard in place handing out backpacks and helping us. Our councilwoman at Lawrence right here. So these are the kind of council people you got up here making decisions, helping us and think about the poor, who our school has been neglected. Ceremony. I'm not sure I heard you correctly. Did you say 60 to 80? No, no. 6 to 8 units. 6 to 8 units. Are you going to build the four, eight stories? Well, I don't know yet. I mean, I have to look at construction costs right now. It's I mean, it's so cost prohibitive. But again, I want to be able to provide some meaningful housing for the neighborhood. And as part of the development there, as you indicated or somebody indicated in the pictures, there are no curbs, gutters, sidewalks. There's not. Redevelopment. Will require you to do that, correct? Correct. Currently, right now, there's no multi-modal transportation or no infrastructure currently to help facilitate any of that process. So right now, if you ride a bike, get lucky because you're going to be riding around on the street. So hopefully with this development, we can get a nice bike path. In fact, we can hopefully we can get a a flyover so the kids can walk to garden place and don't have to try. I had a kid, a friend. They got ran over on that highway when I was in second grade. So I know what it's like to feel death and next to a companion at that early age. Thank you for your call. Thank you. I have no further questions. Thank you. Councilwoman Ortega, Councilman Cashman, you're up. Thank you, Mr. President. And for planning, please. So we're we're zoning from a maximum of eight storeys so we can go to story stage stories. Correct. From the Air Zone district currently doesn't have a maximum height recommendation in stories it's regulated by IFR, and the request is to rezone to an eight story district. That is correct. Exactly. Exactly. So it we'll be anywhere from, I guess, one story to at eight stories. What I'm where I'm going is so we've we've looked at a number of rezonings in this general area over a period of weeks. And so here we are going again with a size we really don't know what it's going to look like. And I wonder if you can just speak to how we project traffic demands and how we assess our ability to handle that. Sure. That's a great question and exactly to your point. At the time of rezoning, we're not able to predict specifically what the product will be built on a particular site. So the traffic impact analysis that you're referring to does take place during the development review process. Exactly. For that point, to understand the mix of uses and the implications from a specific proposed development. So our colleagues at Public Works are transportation engineers would review a proposed development for traffic impacts along with the range of other development standards to understand if any improvements need to be made at the time of rezoning. But the see our x eight zone district does introduce a greater sense of predictability. I would like to think than the current zoning currently applies affords today because of the AIA zone district that doesn't regulate building heights in terms of stories and instead by far so which is more unpredictable. Buildings can be very tall and skinny, can be very low and flat. The current zoning would also allow for parking in between. The building in the street doesn't have standards like transparency and entrance requirements, so those standards are all built into the C r zone district. So there definitely does increase the sense of security and predictability, both for a property owner and the surrounding neighbors as well. Right. So the traffic study is is obviously done after any zoning. That is correct. Okay. And since we have no idea what's going to be built on this land, and I'd be welcome to hear from you, sir, as well. But the question is, is there any thought about affordable housing as a component of this? Sure, I'd be happy to answer. And then Mr. Pine can speak to his specific project. So if the rezoning were to be approved tonight, any development proposal for the subject site would of course, comply with the standards of the S.R. X eight zone district. So in terms of our staff review, we do look to the entitlement that would be allowed by that zone district. So the permitted uses the building forms to see if it implements our adopted plan. So that is primarily the purpose of some of the criteria you saw before you tonight. And in terms of affordable housing, the Denver zoning code generally attempted to reduce barriers in 2010 during the drafting of the code to affordable housing to facilitate it. Of course, zoning is just a very small portion of the conversation about affordable housing, but reduced parking requirements, smaller unit sizes before, and based approach that doesn't regulate development by maximum unit counts, that sort of thing all incentivize affordable housing in a variety of different ways. All right. I just take the opportunity to say that this form of approval, before we have any idea of what's going on, on the land, it makes, it's informed me difficult to assess any vision that's going to unfold. A little too vague. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Sir, did you have something you wanted to add? Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. First of all, I work at the. Go ahead, Mr. O'Brien. I work at the Colorado Department of Transportation, so I have a good, comprehensive understanding in terms of traffic counts, multimodal transportation, not only through the state of Colorado or throughout the entire country and around the world. So in terms of multimodal transportation, believe me, I've been looking at a circulator bus, how to get our residents to the grocery stores, to the brand, to the branch banking and how to make it more efficient and effective. Get the people out of their out of their cars and encourage them to use multimodal transportation and make this building more efficient and effective. I have done some research with Denver Urban Housing and Renewal to make these units affordable. I'm not a big time developer. These aren't million dollar units. This is just something affordable that can maintain the character and the nature of our our community and to be able to enhance the quality of education that our kids receive in our neighborhood. So, again, yes. Am I cognizant of those traffic studies? Have I've done any? No, but I am aware of the traffic council, what I can do as a resident. But more importantly, as I mentioned earlier about smart growth, a smart town. I take all those principles into consideration to make sure and have a good quality product, one that's going to exemplify the city and county Denver, and one that's one that will set the tone for the rest of the world to follow, such as the one called Psaki call smart town. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Appreciate it. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Casper. Any other questions? 642 Seen on public hearings now closed comments. Councilman Brooks, rep. Yeah. Thank you, Mr. President. You know, I think my colleagues bring up some valid points in this area. You know, in the last three months, we've received multiple rezonings in this area. And the access points around the 44, 41st and Fox Tod Station is few. We're grateful for the transportation and the light rail, but we're concerned about the number of the amount of development that that may be happen in the future. And so we just here at the city of Denver and to your manager, many of you know, up here, Chris Nevitt, who has been looking at this area with us and this is going to take a multifaceted approach from CPD Public Works, North Denver Cornerstone Collaborative Collaborative with Kelly lead at the at the lead of this bringing all of these things together to figure out what these actual traffic counts look like, what are some alternate modes of transportation and also trying to figure out, you know, and I think Councilwoman Ortega, I know she will comment on this, but the rail that is so close to the development here. And so, you know, I invite any of my colleagues to be a part of those conversations. We were just starting those. The good the good news about this development is these are these are rezonings. And so the development has not yet come. I don't think the market is quite there yet for the financing of some of these developments. And so it's going to give us some time to make sure that that we get it right as a city in planning in this community. I just want to give a real shout out, though, to Armando Payan, who, you know, most most developers that you work with, you know, maybe they give a little something back to the community or whatever. But few are a part of the fabric of the community. And wherever you go in Globeville, everybody knows Armando's name. And, you know, if someone's respect when you go down the street and everyone says hello. And so I thank you for doing a lot for the community and thank you for always bugging us about Garden Place Elementary . And that's the kind of that's the kind of leaders we need in the city, folks who understand it from from micro and macro. So thank you for your leadership. I'll be supporting this and I hope the rest of my colleagues will. Thank you. Thank you. Councilman Brooks. Councilman Espinosa. Sorry about the multiple clicks there wasn't getting her response. So there are plans in place. Globeville, residents and constituents opined about it and they generated something and it's got a real grand vision. And so but the problem is, is that there are some missing pieces. And I want to sort of talk about that, even though this is not necessarily the right place. The zoning. Yeah. To quote you said, zoning is just a small piece and maybe it needs to be a bigger piece in the in the affordable question, because we still have in a time of incredible prosperity in this city, we we are lagging behind in delivering those affordable units. And maybe our piece isn't big enough for affordability. So to that end, what I would like to encourage my colleagues, because, again, not the process is what it is. And there's sort of the you know, all the checkboxes are checked to approve the rezoning without a project, but maybe we need to work on this displacement and accommodation ordinance of some sort. Because while we're not losing a lot of of residents in this area, I can tell you, as somebody who came from Jefferson Park, where new development did displace a lot of residents, and we had a neighborhood plan in place that we worked on together as a community, and we wanted to capture that and we couldn't. And so the ordinances are aren't there? They weren't there in 20 in 2005. They're not there in 2010. I really hope that in 2025 we're not talking about how this this whole area doesn't have an affordable component, a robust, affordable component in a tod. And so, you know, it's again, it's it's it's a bigger issue and it's a problem that we as a body, I feel we need to address. But it's not particular to this zone, this rezoning. It's a it's a larger context. Thanks. And Councilman Espinosa. Councilman Flynn, you're up. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to echo everything that Councilman Brooks said. It is very inspiring to see Mr. Pion here as a member of the community. When we think of developers in Denver, we don't usually picture Mr. Pion. I worked for the previous five years before coming on this council on the project that is building the commuter rail that built a 41st and FOX station. And I've been in that neighborhood a lot, have been by that property a lot. And I've seen in my mind's eye what someone like you community based can do. I just want to commend you for doing it. And I want to commend you for your interaction with Chairman Sekou. And I want to invite you as you move along, to feel free to call us and keep us abreast of your progress and let us know what we can do to help this happen. Thank you. Thank you. Councilman Flynn. Councilman Cashman, you're up. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. Biden, I would echo that when Councilman Flynn said it is great to see a local man as a developer. The problem is we sitting up here. Zone vague concepts. And we don't know when they're going to unfold. I don't know if you're going to own the property when this gets when a development actually takes place. Yes, sir. You'll be free to respond when I'm done here. But yeah, I'm just letting you know that my questions are not about you as an individual. And no doubt, in no way doubt your commitment to your community or your intention. But it's a little bit like when when a liquor license is granted to to a restaurant, you don't know who's going to be operating that down the road. So you try to figure out the pros and cons of what's best, regardless of what human being is involved. So thank you for your time tonight. I appreciate it very much. Just just one quick comment, Mr. Cashman. I'm in the process of setting up a will to keep this property in my family. As I mentioned before, we've been there since 1963 and have no intentions of leaving. You know this the neighborhood has been dear to my heart. And right now, we're totally invested into into the school right now in the process of changing the school playground into learning landscapes, one where it's more productive. Because you know why when you walk up to that school. Mr. Pines, I appreciate your chance. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate your passion. Councilwoman Ortega, you're up. Thank you, Mr. President. I wasn't sure if you officially closed. Yeah, we did go to comment. This is the comment period. Yes, ma'am. So I wanted to express my support for this. This site is three blocks east of Foch Street and the light rail site where we have other commuter rail or heavy rail, I should say, where we've got cargo that travels on that corridor is even further away. So this particular site would not be directly affected by the issue that I've raised in the past with development that's happening right next to rail. I have worked with Mr. Payan in the Globeville neighborhood for many, many years, and I know of his commitment to the Globeville community and appreciate the fact that he has stepped forward to build some affordable housing in the community. We're going to see a lot of development in this area. You know, we've got one site that's 45 acres, so you'll Denver Post site and we've seen piecemeal rezonings come forward on that particular property. We did one two weeks ago for a different site. That's an existing operating business. But I think the opportunity to ensure that affordability is a big part of what is being developed in that area is very important. As you all know, our work in trying to extract, if you will, affordable units is when we have public financing in the development. And so far, we haven't seen a public financing plan for any of the proposed development. So at which time that comes forward, and that gives us the opportunity to ensure that's part of the big picture conversation. So I will be supporting this rezoning application tonight. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Ortega. Any other comments? 642 Seen on Madam Secretary, roll call. Brooks Clark. Hi. Espinosa. Flynn. Hi. Gilmore. Cashman. I knew. Ortega. Sussman. Black. Mr. President. I. Madam Secretary, please close voting. And as a result, Lebanese Lebanese security is in place on final consideration and does pass. All right. That is the first one. Next, we are on the council, Bill 649. Councilwoman Blakley, please put 6.9 on the floor. Thank you, Mr. President. I move that council bill 649 be placed upon final consideration and do pass. It has been moved and seconded. Public hearing for 649 is now open. And when you are ready, we'll have the staff report for you. Mr. President. Good evening, counsel. My name is Steven Chester, senior city planner with CPD here to present the staff report for 2610 through 2638 West 13th Avenue. A rezoning from au0 to two C Amex eight. This case is very similar to the one you just heard, so forgive me if I go through this a little quickly, but", "result": "Rezones property located 4365 North Cherokee Street from I-A, UO-2 to C-RX-8 in Council District 9. (NEIGHBORHOODS AND PLANNING) Rezones property located 4365 North Cherokee Street from I-A, UO-2 (Light Industrial, Billboard Overlay allowed) to C-RX-8 (Urban Center, Residential Mixed Use, 8 stories) in Council District 9. IF ORDERED PUBLISHED, A PUBLIC HEARING WILL BE HELD ON THIS ITEM.  REFER TO THE \"PENDING\" SECTION OF THE FUTURE COUNCIL MEETING AGENDAS FOR THE DATE. The Committee approved filing this bill at its meeting on 9-16-15."}
{"input": "Council is reconvened. We have two public hearings this evening. Speakers should begin their remarks by telling the council their names and cities of residence and if they feel comfortable doing so, their home addresses. If you're here to answer questions only when your name is called, please come to the podium. State your name and note that you are available for questions of council. Speakers will have 3 minutes and there is no yielding up time on the presentation monitor. On the wall you will see your time counting down. Speakers must stay on the topic of the hearing and must direct their comments to council members. Please refrain from profane or obscene speech. Direct your comments to council as a whole and please refrain from individual or personal attacks if you're standing up in the back. Our fire code does not allow standing back there of us an exit. So we do have overflow next door in 432 or it's on and you'll be able to watch and see what's going on. And if I can ask everybody else to scoot together if there's any room next to you and yeah, there will be a little bit more room after this hearing for the one that I think most people are here for. All right, Councilmember Ortega, will you please put Council Bill 1381 on the floor? Mr. President, I move that council bill 19 1381 be placed upon final consideration and do pass. Thank you very much. It has been moved. Can I get a second? Thank you. It has been moved and seconded. The required public hearing for Council Bill 1381 is now open. May we have the staff report? Thank you, Mr. President, and happy birthday. Good evening, counsel. I'm Kyle Dalton with the Department of Community Planning and Development. I'm substituting for Ellis TV tonight. Who prepared the materials in your record? She's out sick this evening. This is a request to rezone 2060 West Colfax Avenue from Cemex 5 to 8. It's located in Council District three in the Lincoln Park neighborhood. It is located southwest of the interchange of Interstate 25 and Colfax Avenue, north of 14th Avenue and east of the South Platte River. The request to rezone to CMCs eight is to urban center mixed use district that to allow a buildings up to eight stories and there's currently a one story warehouse on the site and the proposal is to rezone in order to facilitate redevelopment surrounding the existing structure. The current zoning ACM x five, which allows buildings up to five stories and it's adjacent to five story zoning and must in most directions except with the open space to the west where the South Platte River is located. It's currently used industrially and is in an area surrounded by office and utilities. Industrial and open space uses. Here's a shot of the property looking northeast towards downtown, generally in an industrial and mixed use context in the near near near of the photograph looking to the intensity of downtown to the northeast. Here's a taste of the site in the surrounding areas. The photo in the middle is the subject site to the above and below are surrounding buildings, showing a generally 1 to 2 story scale with some taller buildings in the area and a mix of building coverage as. The applicant has entered voluntarily into an affordable housing agreement to exceed the minimum city standards. They have committed to a minimum that 10% of all dwelling units will be offered for sale at or below 80% of the area median income, or 60% for rental units for a period of six years. And a minimum of 25% of those units will be at least two bedrooms. The process. They follow the process required by code for a rezoning planning board recommended unanimously that you approve this at a public hearing in December. There are three letters of support from different registered and neighborhood organizations, including in your packet. There's also a letter of support representing two property owned or two businesses and a property owner in your packet. And we've received no other public comments on the application. There are five review criteria. And. Analyze more detail in your staff report. I'll go quickly through the five criteria. The first is that a rezoning must be consistent with adopted plans. It's consistent with the comprehensive plan strategies, including under the Equity Vision element, where it will enable mixed use development, including an increase in allowed housing density near two stations along the light rail line. It's also consistent with the climate recommendations of comprehensive plan 2040. In particular, because it's an infill location where infrastructure is already in place. Again, it's near a couple of light rail stations. It's well connected to the city's Off Street Mobility Network as well, with the proximity to the South Platte River corridor. Turning now to the city's land use and transportation plan blueprint, Denver. The future place contemplated here is the district's place. This is a special district which can be mixed use and offer a diverse range of amenities. That's the context excuse me that the blueprint Denver stipulates for the site, the future place type is innovation flex. And this is contemplated for a mix of employment and residential with buildings that orient to the streets and are pedestrian friendly. In the proposed TMX eight zone district allows a wide and diverse range of uses consistent with this recommendation, including residential office, retail and some light manufacturing uses commonly associated with craft or makerspace and design. It also implements Blueprint Denver's recommendations in terms of the growth strategy in this area of the city, the districts areas we the plan contemplates up to 15% of the city's job growth and 5% of new households. Rezoning would enable growth consistent with that strategy. I'll turn now to a couple of small area plans that also apply to the site. The first is the Decatur Federal Plan, which city council adopted in 2013. It contemplates that this area is a transit oriented character area where the highest intensity development and mix of uses is contemplated. The mapping corresponds with the urban center neighborhood context. And again, we found that the zone district is consistent with this recommendation of the plan. The plan actually also has a building heights map that recommends up to 12 storeys because this applicant is requesting eight storeys that's under the 12 storeys recommended by the plan. And so the zoned district is also consistent with that part of the plan. The last small area plan that applies is the Lama Lincoln Park Neighborhood Plan adopted by council in 2010. It shows this area's mixed use. It's an opportunity for redevelopment to provide jobs, retail and services. And again, we found that the proposed district is consistent with that recommendation. Finally, the citywide housing and inclusive Denver plan that City Council adopted includes recommendations around creating and preserving housing options that are accessible, affordable, mixed income and mixed use, although not required for compliance with the other adopted plans. The affordable housing agreement that was signed by both the city and the property owner that I mentioned earlier is consistent with that plan direction. It's also consistent with the second and third review criteria that will result in uniform application of zone district standards. It will further the public health, safety and welfare there, justifying circumstances due to the adoption of the plans that I mentioned earlier, which identify this as a total area. There have been major planning efforts and redevelopment in the surrounding area as well that justify the change in the zoning. And then finally, the request to district is consistent with the neighborhood context, description, zoned district purpose and intent as specified in the code and as further detailed in your staff report. The applicant is here and is signed up to speak and I'll be happy to answer any questions later. Thank you very much. All right. We have five individuals signed up to speak on this item tonight. First up is Susan Powers. Good evening. Council president and members of the city council. My name is Susan Powers, the president of Urban Ventures, which is a development group in Denver. My home address is 1475 Dale Gainey Street. I wanted to provide a couple of pieces of information that might not come through the normal process here to explain why I'm doing this at this point. Steam on the plot is about a three acre property that we purchased about four years ago, and within it, we have two renovated buildings, one that houses the fantastic New Rises Brewery here and the steam building, which is completely leased to. Has over 400 employees. We have surface parking that meets the code at this point. When we first started the development, it was difficult for us to see this as a place for all for new office development, because it was somewhat pioneering. So we have extra parking that we have leased from the Broncos to meet the needs of the employees. We all recognize that in five, ten, 20 years, nobody is going to have a car. But unfortunately, everybody has a car still at this point, most people do. So we have, as the Broncos have have announced their plans to move ahead with with their redevelopment of the parking lots that they have. I started getting concerned that we would be losing that extra parking and decided that we need to take the steps to move all of our parking needs onto our site. In order to do that, we would be building an eight story structure of which four floors of it would be structured parking, and then four floors will either be office or residential. We haven't made the decision about whether it's residential or office at this point are our lease up is fairly new. We're getting a sense of kind of what the what the energy level is and the interest in in coming into it into the Sun Valley area, which is pretty strong. So it might end up being an office building, but the building would be wrapped with either office or residential. So you wouldn't see see the parking structure from the lower floors and we'll design the parking so that in the future when none of us do have our cars, we can convert that to other uses as the demand for parking goes down over the five years that we've been involved in Sun Valley neighborhood. We've developed deep relationships with members of the community and have brought businesses to stem on the plot that have also become integral partners in the neighborhood. This rezoning will allow us to bring additional jobs or housing to Sun Valley and to address the parking needs at the same time. I appreciate your support and any questions here to answer. Thank you very much. Next up, Jesse Pearce. Good evening. Members of council, those watching at home, those in the audience. My name is Jessica Sharp. Harris and I ran for city council at large last year, almost 15,000 votes with no money. And I'll be running again to be the next mayor of 2023. And I represented for Denver Homicide Law, Black Star Examiner for self-defense, positive action, calling for social change as well as the Unity Party of Colorado and Mile High. No. I was originally against this rezoning because like it was already stated. Sun Valley is really cultural district for the West Side and the natives have been. Displaced in this area. So I was pleased to hear that there was going to be affordable housing potentially at. This site at 80%. Amarillo, that that still kind of rolls me the wrong way. But I see that the occupant did their due diligence and went to the Arnolds in the area and asked them if they approved of this. And I didn't see any letters of opposition to this. So there's really nothing I'm going to tell you that's going to not make you pass this because it's already been set in stone. And like I said, the Arnolds haven't went against it and there's no letters of opposition. So with that being said, I have to approve this. Thank you. Thank you. Next up, Jose Tito. Sorry. He gets butchered all the time. Happy birthday, by the way. Good evening, council members. My name is Joseph Ed. I recited 769 South Hudson Street. I attended a 2060 was Colfax Avenue. I race brewing company which many of you have been able to visit. And I wanted to talk in favor of of of passing this because as I'm here to speak more about the character of the applicant, Susan Powers and her team have been excellent in furthering opportunities for people of color, women and other minorities. And we are Latino on Hispanic, on Mexican, on LGBTQ, on veteran owned business that is doing really well thanks to affordable commercial real estate, real estate provided by by Susan. And we welcome this change in density, because that means more business not just for us, but for the businesses within STEM on the planet and within businesses within that fine line between Lincoln and Sun Valley. Right now, that's a little bit of a desert, but thanks to the spark that has been happening in that area. We welcome this kind of density done in a proper way, just the way that Susan and her team are doing. So thank you for considering my words. Thank you. Thank you. Next up, Chairman Sekou. Yes. Good afternoon. When I was chairman, Sekou, the founder, organized the Black Star Action Movement for Self-defense. Born and raised. Denver 68 years. And voice for the oppressed, the poor. Vulnerable. This. Is consistent. With the plan. I'm like everyone who comes here to do a zoning change. All of them have been cookie cutters into a format that is working to make this have some consistency throughout the city. And I salute the council for working on this, because this is an owner's task to do, especially when you get it at this stage of the city's development. And so I support this because to not support this, I would be a hypocrite and supporting other neighborhoods and not supporting this one. And I do have some concerns. The process that we're doing. And the modernization of these neighborhoods. A starting to distort the character of the city. We're now we're starting to look like New York. And that's not who we are. This is the wild, wild west. And we have a certain thing that happens out here with everyday folks. There's a certain integrity and honesty about the people who just tell you flat out whether we like it or not. And we like to be like, you know, we don't you don't want no games being played with this and now we're losing who we are. See, when we do these kind of things and we have buildings that go up that are not consistent to the history of who we are. I don't even know what they look like. Vertical penitentiaries. Everybody's stacked on top of each other and anal space and develops a certain mental sickness like they got in New York where people don't even talk to each other. No. And everybody is suspicious of everybody because you're cooked up into some kind of container and you're not free to breathe. See, there's something wrong with that picture. And at this stage in my life. I don't even know who we are anymore. So I don't know. So. As I get better at this thing. I am. Thank you. Next up, Jeannie Granville. Good evening. My name is Jean Granville, 2715 West told in place. I am here tonight as president of the Sun Valley Neighborhood Organization. It's called the Sun Valley Community Coalition. We did send in a neighborhood position. Statement which should. Have been passed on to you, I think, in your packets. But I would just like to take a moment to point out a few of those things as to why we're supporting this rezoning and really commend the applicant Urban Ventures and Sue Powers and her team as what we consider to be kind of a model for developers , new developers that we know will be coming into the Sun Valley area. As you're well aware, Sun Valley is embarking upon a huge transformation, and I will just. Point out a. Few of those things. A couple of which you've heard the steam on the Platte development has environmentally cleaned. Up and. Restored blighted property with sensitivity to preserve historical structures that characterized the Lower Colfax area has attracted encouraged tenants committed to hiring from the neighborhood whenever possible. Being active in and contributing to the Sun Valley neighborhood has provided affordable business opportunities for people of color. And women such as bold beans, coffee through girls, ink and rice brewing has volunteered and contributed. Attend to numerous neighborhood activities and cultural events, and as part of the neighborhood organization and other numerous local planning activities, continues to. Demonstrate commitment to providing economic. Opportunities that promote Sun Valley's values of diversity, inclusion, and equitable and viable economic opportunity. While we realize that this is primarily a commercial venture, the rezoning to. Allow in well, in support. Of a commercial venture, we really do commend Urban Ventures for also exploring the very much needed affordable housing that we. Know. We will be pursuing within the neighborhood. So I urge your support and thank you. Thank you. That concludes our speakers on this item. Are there any questions from members of council? Councilman Cashman. Thank you, Mr. President. Either for my powers or Kyle. I'm just where I am. Not clear on where things are at, on whether there's going to be affordable housing or not. Oh, there's there's an affordable housing agreement that we've signed and it's been recorded. Okay. So but if we if we choose to do office, then we would pay the fee instead of building the housing. So but we did sign the agreement. But we don't know today. We don't know today. Thank you. That's all. Mr. Press. Mr. President. Thank you. Mr. President, if I may. For my colleagues, some of the materials were not in our granicus and Zack has emailed them. So the affordable housing plan and the updated PowerPoint, which includes some of the affordable housing details, is in our email. And I know I don't always see my email in the middle of a hearing, so I wanted folks to know it was in there. Thank you, Councilmember Councilmember Hines. Thank you, Mr. President. I just wanted to say, Miss Powers, thank you for for moving this forward. And I think. Councilman, we're still in questions. We're going to get to comments and maybe I had a question come in, but I want to send it. All the way with it, too. Okay. Thank you. I will get back to you in just a second. Councilmember Ortega. If you wouldn't mind coming to the microphone. So if you were just building and you were allowed to continue to do to use the parking at the stadium, you wouldn't need to reason. Correct. You're doing this so that you can accommodate the parking onsite. Well, yeah. I mean, because. We were you have that long, Tony. Built, any building we put in there is going to take the onsite parking off of it anyway. So we would we would still need to replace the parking that we have on site somewhere. And so we would be building structures. Okay. So I was just trying to understand the primary reason why you needed to rezone. Yeah, well, and that is for the addition, the parking that is on the stadium. You're right. We need to build a structure. This will make it a higher structure. And that's the reason is, is that it's in order to bring back the spaces that are on the stadium site, onto the site. Now it has to get above five storeys. And we don't really know the timing of when the stadium is going to want to move forward. But this creates that stability. Right. That's exactly right. Thank you. Sure. Thank you, Councilmember. All right. Seeing no other questions. The public hearing for Council Bill 1381 is closed, and now it's time for comments from members of council. Councilmember Torres. Thank you, Mr. President. I just I really want to thank Susan for the work that you've done thus far in Urban Ventures. Jean Granville is absolutely correct. Sun Valley is undergoing a huge transformation. This is accurate and it puts tremendous responsibility on the city and on this council to make sure that it's not done at the expense of families who have sustained that neighborhood for generations with very little attention. From what I've seen in terms of the renovation at Steam on the Platt building and the renovation of the building where race operates, I'm excited to see what comes of this particular vision. I've currently been holding my coffee and community at the Bold Beans location, which is on the first floor of Steam on the plot. It is fully occupied and it's a makerspace, which is, I think, the vision moving forward even into the commercial vision of the next building. So you have folks who are creating things, which is something that we've lost in Denver, are dedicated spaces to makers. And so I'm excited about that being a part of the Sun Valley future and vision on a continued basis. This this space carries forward that in addition to community space, reflection of the Sun Valley community and respect of of the river and, and the land commitment that we have there as well. So I'm I'm really thrilled about this. I'll be supporting it. I hope my my colleagues will as well. And just really appreciate all the due diligence that you've done community wide on this project. Thank you, Councilmember. Councilmember Hines. I do have a couple questions. No, I'm just kidding. So I feel like a repeating myself. Myself. But I do want to thank you. I don't have questions, but I want to thank Ms.. Powers for your for your hard work on this. I want to thank staff as well for your hard work. I know it's not every day that you get both all the nays turned to. Yes. So, you know, when you get Jessie Paris and chairman say you go from a no to a yes. That's pretty awesome. So. And no letters against it. So thank you very much for all your work and making sure that this is a unanimously in favor. So thank you. Thank you. Councilmember Councilmember Torres, you back up? I did because I wanted to make sure folks knew exactly what rentals at 60% AMI and for sale at 80% am. I means if it's a rental, it's 60%. And you were a single individual, you were earning up to $39,000 a year. If you're two people, you're earning together $44,580. If it's for sale at 80%. Ami for one person, that's somebody who's earning less than $52,000 a year and for a couple, jointly, 59,400 a year. So we're still talking about workforce housing, folks who might be teachers, who might be cops, who might be firefighters who still need to find places to live in the city. So I just wanted to share those numbers. Thank you, Councilmember Councilmember Cashman. Thank you, Mr. President. You know, normally I would be pretty concerned. Without a definite yes, there's going to be affordable housing. I hear it's in the plan and an option. I have watch list power since her days with the Urban Renewal Authority many, many moons ago. And I fully believe that by looking at what's come before that, whatever is built on this piece of ground will be in in line with the values we hold as a community. So I'll be glad to support this this evening. Thank you, Councilmember. All right. Seeing no other comments, Madam Secretary, roll call. Torres. I black. I CdeBaca. Flynn I. Herndon. HINES All.

Legislation was held July 10th, 2017. Senator Herbold, thank you. First off, I want to thank the commissioners for coming today to share in their own words why this legislation is so important to them. I don't have a whole lot more to add because they did such a great job in keeping with my philosophy that folks on the ground doing the work are the best advocates for why the work is so important. The changes to the commissions are have been proposed by the four commissioners, the four commissions that came together and made this proposal jointly to to the Council. And I, in my role as chair the committee, want to do everything I can to to help them do their work. I respect and recognize the fact that this is these are four very important volunteer bodies. And by expanding the size of their commission, many of the tasks that they do well, they will then be able to share that work with a larger group of people, which will make them both more effective and more focused as well. So there have been some concerns I've heard from folks about that, this by expanding the commission that this will somehow create some sort of a budget impact. This is actually just the opposite. This is so that they don't have to rely on Office of Civil Rights staff to do some of this work so that they can they can do the bulk of the work themselves. The bill would expand to all four commissions, to 21 members and allow the commissioners 2.4 of the 21 Council point eight, the mayor 0.8. And there was one additional get engaged appointment. Thank you, guys. I'm sorry I heard any further comments. Councilmember Bagshaw. Thank you. I especially want to say thank you to our Women's Commission who are here today and LGBTQ.

I completely concur with you about getting somebody who is experiencing blindness or deafness on that commission. And I hope you circle my office at Sally Dot Bagshaw.

{"input": "Thank you, Madam Clerk. Next item. Item 23. Communication from Councilman Austin. Councilman Urunga. Recommendation to direct City Manager to delay any action regarding requests for an international customs facility at the Long Beach Airport until receiving further direction from the city council and until 90 days after the representation on the city council is completed. Okay, thank you. I'm going to turn this over now to Councilmember Austin. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I want to thank my colleague, Councilmember Urunga, for cosigning on this item. He is a true champion for our neighborhoods here in Long Beach. I want to start out and I want to be very clear that this agenda item does not address the merits of building the customs facility at the Long Beach Airport. Surely we will have that conversation at some point, possibly in the future. However. But I am troubled. For more than two years. JetBlue and Long Beach Airport officials have had early discussions and have been discussing a federal inspection services and a customs facility. We've just learned that there have been a lot of movement. There's been a lot of movement, resources and staff time committed to this issue. With no direction whatsoever from the city council. There are even discussions with the Department of Homeland Security and financial feasibility studies prepared. And objections from the City Council. How much of this effort? More than a year ago. Now we have a formal request from JetBlue for the city to submit an application for customs facility. And it makes sense for us to cool the jets, slow down on this very sensitive issue. Actually, tonight is the first time this issue is even being publicly discussed by the council, let alone we take a vote. So what are we seeking to do here before the city manager takes direction from the City Council on how to proceed with this request? There should be full representation on the City Council. Now, just to put it in perspective, I don't think we would have moved forward on a Belmont pool project had there been no council representative in the third District most recently. And I'm sure there would have been serious objections with moving forward with the Civic Center project if there were no representative from the Second District or the First District at the time. And we certainly don't want to move forward with a medical marijuana policy that oversaturate the ninth District if the ninth District doesn't have a council representative there either. Many residents who live in a fourth district live directly under the flight path of the airport. And I believe it's undemocratic to move forward with this issue in any way when such a key district does not have a voice or vote on the city council. We must also give time for that representative who will be elected in just over a month to get time to have time to be brought up to speed. There's a lot that comes at you when you're a brand new city council member. And for that fact, I think we held up a lot of business for the city to allow five new city council members to get seated and to get their feet underneath them so that they could get caught up on the issues. I think we all the same consideration for this new new councilmember coming in. For anyone who may disagree with me tonight recommended action. I'm sorry. I simply ask, what is the rush and whose timetable are we working under? The request was made for the city council and the city to move forward. And so we are driving this process. Not any company, not any airline in the spirit of decency and fairness to more than 500,000 residents in our city who do not have a seat behind this dais tonight, it is only right to delay this action or any action or considering this request for a few months. All three candidates from the fourth District seat have asked the city council in writing to delay this issue until 90 days after this seat is filled. One of these three candidates will soon be our colleague on the council. We even have a letter here from former councilmember in the fourth District and now state assembly member Patrick O'Donnell requesting the same and supporting this agenda item here today as well. As is often the case, I fully expect there will be efforts this evening to offer friendly amendments and substitutes and substitute substitutes. And I just want to be very, very clear. The JetBlue's lobbyists and the JetBlue folks have been very active in contacting our city council members and asking for this timetable to be minimized. Let me state that I consider that any proposal that fails to recognize the need for a voice from the fourth District residents before any action is taken by our city manager or staff would not be viewed as a friendly amendment. It runs counter to the intent to have a democratic process on this issue. This is an issue that can impact thousands of residents throughout our city. And so let's make sure that all the Long Beach has a voice. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Isom. Yeah. Customer your income. Thank you, Mayor. I want to echo the sentiments of my colleague from the eighth District. This is a too important topic to not have a full council on. So I too, I support the motion by my my council colleague to delay this action until there is a full, full city council on board. Okay. Think it comes from rearing someone to move on. I do have some speakers that we're going to go to. Of course, we have public comment, so we're going to go to have we have some I think there are some questions and speakers first and then we'll get to public comment, then we'll go back to the Council for deliberation. Vice Mayor Lowenthal. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I may have missed this. Was there a motion? There was not. Whether I believe that I may see a motion plugged in and think he said it, but he plugged into the system. So I'm sorry. I'm not even looking at the system. I apologize. Yes, there was a motion. Yes, we have a motion in a second. Austin uranium. Okay. I do have a few questions. And the first question I have is and most people don't need this, but just just for my own edification. Mr. City Attorney, if if you could just summarize perhaps what the distinction here is between this issue that we're taking up and the conversation that we're having and the concerns that a lot of people have, and rightly so, the concerns that people have about the noise bucket and and whether this actually impacts or any action such as this would impact that. Mayor, members of the council. Just to reiterate what was discussed at the study session on the airport there, the noise ordinance is not technically implicated by where the flights originate from or to. It is a cumulative accumulation of the noise created by the jets landing and taking off. So it is not related to or tied to this item before you this evening. Thank you. And then. For the city manager so that those of us who aren't privy to all of the work that you're doing or even the conversations that council may have had in previous council meetings, if this motion if this item had not been before us, what was the work that you would have done or what is the work you would have done? What's the process you would have taken? Could you describe that for us? Vice Mayor Council Members We would then begin, probably hire a consultant and go through a study to look at the financial feasibility of this, look at the geographic feasibility, look at how it fits operationally, administration. And then probably in about five months, in July or August, we would come back to the city council for the city council to set policy. Okay. Thank you. That's all I have right now, Mr. Mayor. Thank you. And except Councilwoman Mongo. I just wanted to make a statement about how I feel about my responsibility as a council person and how it differs from the letter written by a colleague that I respect and admire greatly. While I am elected by the members of the Fifth District, I think that each and every one of us have taken an oath of office to represent each and every person in this city, and that visits the city. And so when people come up to me and ask if I'm their council person, I say, of course, because I, I vote on $3 billion in budgets annually and the future and contracts related to millions of dollars in vendors, the pensions and benefits of hundreds of police officers, firefighters and public service workers and each and every one of those items is of importance to me. Specifically, I think that we as a council owe both our residents and our businesses a process this weekend while spending an additional amount of time in the fourth District, the place where I get my dry cleaning done, and my favorite frozen yogurt shop, which I spent a bit of time at. Residents often approach me and ask, Can you help with this? Can you help with that? Of course, because we as a council represent each and every one of you. While as a district representative, I take the lead on certain things related to cups or business licenses. That doesn't mean that my colleagues at any time would not vote for residents if they felt that I was not doing my diligence as a council member for the city. And so one of the challenges I have with the letter is it implies that the Fourth District is not represented, and I want each and every one of you to know that you are represented. I have lived in the flight path in two different locations. I have a multitude of family members who currently live in the flight path, as I've mentioned before. Every few months I remember as a child watching the screens from the windows and the soot on the cars from living in the flight path. And my parrot. My grandparents bought that land when the airport was just a little speck in people's eyes. And so he built that home that we lived in and. The difference can be, too, that often we buy our homes knowing and understanding the things that are there and the protections that are in place. And we need to balance that with ensuring that every business has the right to bring forward a request to this council and to be considered timely. I may not agree with some of the items before this council, whether it's the marijuana ordinance or the logic labor agreement or any other item. But the constituents are represented and every business is given that due diligence and the way that I currently read the memo from the city manager. This is a three year process. A delay of an additional three weeks is pandering. To this crowd because it's it's insignificant in a three year plan, which will take an exuberant amount of time. And so those that's my perspective. There is no way that our city staff would be able to bring back the information until the time at which our council members. Our new council member colleague will be seated. I have great respect for the three colleagues. I moderated their debate earlier this week. I think any of them would be able to digest this information. They seemed very informed on the matter in front of the public that was there then. And I have confidence in their abilities now and then. So with that being said, I have no more comments. Okay. Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilwoman Price. Thank you. I have a couple questions for staff. First, I want to say that. I understand where Councilman Austin is coming from. I've talked with him about this issue. I know he's very concerned, as are all the council members. But he has he represents a constituency that we don't all represent. He has his own unique constituency and issues. And I've spent a lot of time talking to him about his concerns. And I do believe him when he says that this item is not about the merits of the proposal, but rather allowing us to be in a place where we have representation. And I think there's some validity there. And while I didn't think about that on this issue, I will say that this council has before it another very important issue, and that's the medical marijuana ordinance. And it's interesting to me, because the fourth District has a series of businesses that were negatively impacted by illegal medical marijuana dispensaries. They feel very passionately about that subject. And yet the current timeline that the council has in place for making a vote on that doesn't even include the fourth District representative being elected. And so I think there is a lot of merit to the idea of having representation from all of the districts, because although Councilwoman Mango may have her finger on the pulse of the Fourth District residents, I certainly don't. I represent the entire city, but my day to day obligation is to the residents of my district. So I think their councilperson would be in the best position to know what it is their constituents feel, and I think they would take that very seriously. So I think there's a lot of merit there. I also like and I hadn't heard it before, but the analogy to some of the big things that we voted on recently, we would not think for a moment about voting on the pool or the shot create issue if there was not a third district council person in the seat, because those are issues that heavily impact my district. So I think there I think he has some great merits on it, but I do have some questions for staff in regards to this process, and it's mostly just to educate myself on the process. So is there any work that the staff has to do before we vote, before we move forward with JetBlue's request, before we can actually move forward with JetBlue's request? Councilmember Mayor, first off, I'd like to make a comment that our airport director, Bryant Francis, had a long standing commitment outside the city. So he's not here tonight. We have our financial bureau manager, Claudia Lewis, with us to answer any specific questions. But this is a pretty general once I'll answer it. Basically, in order for us to go approach the federal customs facility, we would have to do our own study and get our own request from the city council. Whether the council views, whether this is a good idea or a bad idea to send an application forward. But we would need, like I said, about a five month time period to conduct a study, bring it to the council, and the council would take the next step. Now, would you need any direction from council to actually undertake that process. Given the item that we have tonight? I certainly would request direction. Yes. Absent this meeting, we would probably just process it. Okay. Okay. And in regards to this particular item, I would like to ask the maker of this motion. Council member Austin and your. Would you be open to a friendly amendment to move the time period to 60 days after the person is seated to give them the opportunity to get caught up? Because I do agree with some of the points that have been made that I think we should wait. However, given the relevance of this topic and how frequently it's been coming up during the campaign trail, I expect that our future colleague will be very well versed on this issue. So I'm just wondering if you're open to that. Mr. Austin. Well, I can tell you that when Councilmember Urunga and I first had this conversation early Monday morning before we could put our agenda item in last week, we we were fully aware that, that, you know, our 90 day, um, ask could be be seen as a little ambitious considering the fact that we have 30 days before we're 30 days out from an election and then possibly 60 days or even more after that. The 90 days was an arbitrary number to give us some cushion. I personally would would would I would be okay to a friendly amendment for 60 days, but nothing less. And if I knew that that I could get full council support on this on that I don't I don't want to. Undermine the importance of of delaying this and giving the fourth District Council member, the new council member coming in all of the room possible to to to be fully brought up to speed. And when I say fully brought up to speed, they have to step up in office. They have to figure out a mechanism to outreach and bid and get community support or to have a town hall meeting with their their constituents on this. And so when we do the 90 days out there, we thought that was fair. But, you know, if I'd be open if I thought that there was some if we can get some consensus as a council on this. And that's where I'm coming from. Council member Austin is I'm trying to find if there's a way that we can meet in the middle and effectuate the intent of, of this agenda item. You know, one thing I didn't mention carries a lot of weight with me is our former colleague, Assemblyman O'Donnell's letter. That carries a lot of weight with me because I don't think there is a single council member that I've studied in history that had his finger on the pulse of his community as well as Council Councilman O'Donnell did. And he is telling us from Sacramento, my constituents need to be heard. They need someone advocating for them specifically. That carries a lot of weight with me. I wasn't expecting to see this letter when I walked in tonight. I knew what your position was and certainly was sensitive to that. But I think to me, this this letter says a lot because he's the closest thing to a representative that they have right now. So, anyway, I appreciate you accepting that. Now, what about. Okay, I'm just going to stop there. Thanks for now. Thank you, Counselor Richardson. Thanks, Mr. Mayor. So just a couple of things. And, you know, I have my iPad up and I intentionally pulled up my my favorite game video game because I really didn't want to get into this conversation. But I think I'm going to jump in. So I would say that I'm serious. I got Star Wars. So I would say that, you know. This is a neighborhoods issue, the ninth District, not in the flight path, but they're on our neighbors flight path. Right. It's important to my neighbors. It's important to me. It's that simple. I think what's being asked for is is reasonable. But I'm lacking a whole bunch of context in terms of in terms of like I'm not I'm not entirely clear that we would be debating this issue at the city council within the next 120 days or 90 days after the election anyway . I would need to just hear from the city manager. Like, when were you planning on bringing this to the council? Are we talking about this because this agenda item was placed on and we wouldn't have been talking about this otherwise. Councilor, mayor, council members. We'd been discussing with the city council privately, but also more importantly with JetBlue that we weren't going to accept any application for a Customs facility until we had a new airport manager, airport director in the seat and established. So basically we were getting ready to process that because Brian Francis had been there for has been here for enough time to initiate a study. Then given the interest in the city council and neighborhood, it's here before the city council. So we certainly at this stage would request if we if we went forward, we would want city council direction. I guess my question is when if this item hadn't been brought, what was your plan to bring to bring this discussion to the city council? See if we were interested. The Council would know that we're initiated it. But but the first time the council would see. The plan would be when the study was complete, probably. In July or August. Okay. So in in how you develop your plan. Are there? Is this just an inward analysis that you and all your airport staff do? Or do you have to do outward communication to customs or federal agencies or anyone else to express interest in the airport? I believe it's more internally, but that's. A question I'm going to refer. To Claudia Lewis. So if I understand. Correctly, the question. Is what type of outreach would we do? Is is the study the study you're doing, are you expressing to the public or to other agencies that might have some scope, some sphere of influence on this decision? Are you expressed are you communicating with them about the study or is this something you can conduct in-house? So to be clear, there's there's no study going on right now. However. The the study would be done likely by an expert in the field. Who would look to. Other similarly situated airports bring in. Information regarding Customs and Border Protection and what the requirements there would be. So. So there would be outgoing. We would consult with those agencies to figure out. Absolutely. And that consultation, that process, does that cost money? Ordering the study would cost money. As had it been appropriate. Is there a budget for this? We would work within the airport. Parameters with their enterprise fund to do that. Yes. I would I would just say and I don't have any motions or any substitutes or any friendlies, I would just say this, I'm not in any rush to jump into this discussion. I'd like to have an understanding of like what's out there. If that means city staff do their internal due diligence without necessarily particularly expressing to customs or someone else that we're interested. I think I'd like to say I have the facts. I think what my colleague is is asked for in terms of allow the council to be full. I'm not sure if that would have happened any way before we had it, but I think it's a fair question to ask. I you know, I agree. I wouldn't want this type of discussion take place if I wasn't on the city council or someone with the ninth District wasn't in it. But I would say that I don't necessarily agree that the rest of the council would necessarily put on a medical marijuana in district or wasn't someone to sit in there. But that's just my own personal opinion. But but. But here's what I would say. Like. I want to get out of the signs and the jargon and the politics and see the facts. So if you do what, no matter what happens tonight, I want to see. I would want to see, like the facts from city staff, whatever analysis internally. I don't want you to communicate out to other agencies. I wouldn't want you to express that we're interested, but have the facts. So when the fourth district is seated, we're not having another conversation because so far this is us. We had a study session, we couldn't talk about this issue and now we're having a second council item tonight where there's no facts on the issue. When it comes back again, when the fourth District is seated, I don't want to be in a place where there's no facts. So I guess my question is, is there a clear line, a distinct line between conducting a full study that engages customs and expresses our interest and a study that we can do internally to tell us the bottom line facts about the thing, the issues that folks care about. But that's my question. Councilman, if I could answer that, first off, I want to make it clear that any study that we did would not go to Customs and express an interest in this. This would just be a fact finding study when the council reviews it, it would not come with a recommendation. It would not say do this, or it could easily disappear in 30 days. If we find out it was financially feasible, then we would just stop and inform the council that we can't do this. But if it was financially feasible, we would continue it. But it would come to the council without a recommendation. It would merely say this is feasible. Does the city council want to take the next step? And the next step would then be to express an interest in this. We would not be expressing an interest through the study. The study would be fact finding. I also want to point out that what you're asking for, for staff to do an internal fact finding thing, we would not be able to do that. We couldn't meet your needs and that that's why we would have to go to an outside expert so we. Would not be. Able to to meet your needs in producing some type of an internal report that we can get to you. Without going to an outside consultant and taking the four or five months. I understand. So if this. So what would happen if this motion moves forward? Then after the fourth District councilperson was seated, then you would come back to City Council for permission to go out and do a study. Or you would wait until the 190 day or 120 days? We would we would wait to what the motion says, and I'll look to the city attorney. But if the motion says 60 days after the council member is seated, the study begins, we would keep this on a shelf. And in 60 days after the councilman receded, we would begin the study. If we got that direction, if the council said, if the motion said, come back to us in 60 days to see if we want to do it, we would do that. So it depends on what the motion reads from the city council. But again, at that 60 day point that the five month trigger would start, it would not start now. It would start 60 days after the member was seated. I get it. So really the question is, do you start your study now or do you start your study? Do you start your study essentially now based on direction or do you start the study three months after the fourth? This person is seated. Two months. Forgive me that that's the question. I mean, that's essentially the options that the council has today. That's a question. That's for the council to decide. We will respond to whatever, I guess. I think I think they're a quick point of information. And it was a report of information, as I mentioned in my opening comments. First of all, this this this agenda item request that that no action delay any action regarding the request until receiving further direction from the city council and and originally stated 90 days after a city council member from the fourth District received it. And I also want to raise the point that there was the airport did undergo a feasibility study. And there are facts laid out in that feasibility study for this council to consider it in point before that as well. Can we go back to the speakers list? What I'm going to do is I have a lot of people queuing up from before, so I'm gonna go to Mr. Andrews and then going go to this to the public, and then we'll go back to the council unless there's any objection from those are queued up. Okay. Unless you want to go for the public is up to you. Oh, no, that would be too late. I go first. Okay. Go now. Mr. Andrews? Yes, by all means, yes. I also. I and you know, Councilman Austin, I really, truly understand, you know, your concerns and your compassion. You know, about this item. But I mean, we all have responsibilities to our constituents. You know, I believe that we need to begin the process of gathering information because the city has never been harmed by having too much information. You know, it's information that we need. And I've heard a lot of speculation, but no facts. And I would like to hear what the city manager, the city attorney airport and JetBlue has to say. Even though getting this report would probably get back to this probably after 90 days, 90 days, but I'm willing to go along, you know, starting the process after 60. You know, that's a friendly amendment. Thank you. Okay. Now we're going to go over to the public and we're going to go back to the council. So, again, 3 minutes, please, everyone, just come forward. If you come forward, if you can just begin to line up at the podium and just make sure you give your name and address and we'll go from please come forward . How are you doing? Good. My name is Greg HERWICK at 2024. I am in the fourth District. I am not represented. I was very happy to hear about Pat O'Donnell's letter showing up. Thank you so much for being happy about it. We're happy about it because we are not represented. Pat was really tight within our community and pretty much everybody knew him as with or without the airport issue personally and for the people that live in my community. We don't need an international airport. LAX is not that far. Orange County is not that far. It's ridiculous that we would want to have bigger flights, noisier flights come into our community. It doesn't make any sense. Has anybody in the city council I know there's some new people here. Is anybody heard of the Triangle of Death? That's what Long Beach has basically been represented as this. More flights, more noise, more pollution coming through the middle of the Triangle of Death. That's basically how Long Beach is looked at. They long they line up from the pyramid, come over public schools. It's not about necessarily the noise or the number of flights. It's about the pollution. It's about how it affects our kids. The noise bucket, in my personal opinion, is a joke. If you live in the flight path or if you live on the take off or, you know, we're more on the landing side, it's it's it's a joke to the, you know, to the people in the community, the 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. flights. That's a joke as well. They they break that all the time. We had flights taken off at five, six, 7 a.m. on a regular basis. There is nothing that controls this airport. And all you're going to do is make it bigger and get it more out of control for the people that live in the flight paths. That's it. I appreciate you putting on the snow day and picking up that slack from Pat O'Donnell and you guys coming out. But we need to be. Represented and before anything goes on, we. Need to be represented. Thank you. Next week, a police. Good evening, Honorable Mayor Council members. My name is John Deeds. I reside at 3600 Pacific Avenue. I have lived there for going on 45 years. But for the first 27 years of my life, I had a Naples home address. And just want to inject a little historic fact here. The last time that a recall effort qualified to go to a ballot. Was directed at my father, the third district councilperson and Tom Clark. And it was over there supporting. Jet service at Long Beach Airport. And with that, I will ask that you support Councilman Austin's motion. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Good evening. My name is Josephine Long. I've been a homeowner in the seventh District for about 25 years, and I opposed the international flight from the JetBlue Airlines. I love JetBlue. And as I look, I try to travel to them as much as possible. But as far as the international flights, I think they would only, as they previously said. More noise, more deaths, more traffic. More everything. That's not good for Long Beach. In L.A.X. is less than 30 minutes away. And so there's no problem going to there or any of the other airports that have the international flights. But I think the homeowners that live in in Long Beach, as I said, they don't agree with the fact that they do fly earlier and later. They note it and it's an inconvenience for the homeowners there. So I ask you to take it into consideration and please do not allow them to have the international flights. Thank you. Thank you so much. And because the city attorney will consistently remind me and remind us, I just want as a reminder, the item before us is on the argument about the motion on the floor, which is to postpone any action until after the fourth District person is seated. So we want to make sure that we're keeping the the comments to that action. Thank you, sir. John Dilatory addresses on file. Honorable Mayor, City Council. Thank you for the opportunity to speak. Everyone says, including everybody up there, that they will support and defend the Long Beach Noise Ordinance. The fact is, Long Beach has never successfully defended our airport noise ordinances. Our first ordinance adopted by the City Council in 1981 allowed a maximum of 15 daily flights. In 1983, 14, airlines challenged our ordinance in court. That federal district court determined that there were there was insufficient basis to support the 15 and up to to 18 1986. The City of Long Beach adopted an ordinance to limit the number of commercial carriers to 32. 1989, the ninth District Court invalidated the 1986 ordinance and ordered an increase to 41 per day that we have today. In 2000, two American Airlines challenged our slot distribution and alluded to their assault on our noise ordinance. If an agreement had not been reached with JetBlue to relinquish four slots to American, the paperwork was ready to file against the city. Mary Garcia City Manager. Patrick West. This direction to postpone any further discussion on allowing JetBlue a Customs facility should also apply to you and your staff. City management, no doubt under the guidance of Mayor Foster and now you. Garcia has moved this project forward behind closed doors since 2013. There are if you actually take a look, there are studies looking at this that says this is not really that feasible financially for us. That was done in 2013. Working in the dark without any public participation. And transparency is not why you were elected to serve as mayor. Please wait for the fourth District Council person to be elected. Then let's have an open discussion to see if it's even worth pursuing an international airport. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Dennis Dunne, a staff update. I beg your indulgence for 10 seconds. I was presented with this document with what I was required to get. However, this is not enough. The map with the districts, the phone numbers should be enlarged and put in the library. It put it in the lobby, not on a table. Forgotten it. Thank you, Mr. Dunn. Next speaker, please. David Lewis, 840 West, 28/7 District. Last week, I was at a friend's house down in Orange County. Disney fireworks went off. I was startled. Didn't know what. It was at first. He said It's. Disney comes with the territory. Sunday night I was in my backyard yard. The smell of the, I guess, gas coming from the refineries over the way was nauseating. I've lived in Long. Beach for 20 years. In Wrigley. For 15. Comes with the territory. We had boats backed up in the air and in the waters here. Years ago there was talk about the US. Comes with the territory. I recognize what Long Beach is. It's a trade place with the ports. Not only does. Our local community, our federal community, but the world. Economy depends upon movement of goods and services out of Long Beach. I almost have a fatal. Attitude about living in Long Beach. And I don't think it's fair. I don't think. That Long Beach residents should go through the health risks that we go through. But I recognize. That it comes with the territory. We're not going to be able to slow down. The commerce at the ports comes with the territory. Now there there. You know, JetBlue wants to have an international airport at the Long Beach Airport. And we all know what that means. We all know where that's going to what that's going to mean. It's going to mean more revenue for JetBlue, more revenue for Long Beach. But at what price? There comes a time when we have to put not our health, but our children's health first before revenue. I know that it's kind of hard to stop the wheels of. Money. But that's what this is all about. JetBlue city of Long Beach making money. But at what price? Thank you, sir. Next speaker, please. My name is Mario Cruz. I reside at 2315 Charlemagne in the fourth District, and I rise in support of Mr. Gurung. Mr. Austin motion to delay this vote. I appreciate his comments. As a resident of the fourth District, I have a voice and the residents of the fourth District have a voice, and that voice needs to be heard. I'm all for process, but there's also accountability. And with all due respect, none of you answer to my vote because I do not have a representative on this council. So notwithstanding your good remarks, you do not answer to me. Because I have not voted. And I want to vote. As far as time, it's not just the matter. Of bringing the council up to speed. There's the community consider. The community has to be about speed. You can't put a time limit on that. And certainly 60 days is not enough, in my opinion. So I would. Good asked. Asked Mr. Ralston in agreeing to reject the friendly amendment when he as much time as we can get to consider this very important issue for the residents of the Fourth District. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Yes. Good evening. Ron soc, formerly of the airport commission from 2000 to 2008. I don't know where to begin. Maybe just a few facts there. I've heard statements tonight that international flights mean more flights, mean noisier flights jeopardize the noise ordinance. The sooner that we can get to the point of studying this and showing that it will be, it's apparent that JetBlue is not asking for more flights right now. They're flying 20 to 25 flights out of their 32. They need to fill those gaps to make it more economically viable for them and for the city. And so they're simply asking for international flights, which are just the same number of planes, same number of gates. No increase. No increase in noise. And so some of these facts, some of these claims have to be dealt with because there is a serious misunderstanding in the community. And the other point that I want to make is that one of the things when I headed the commission that we stressed was that the members, as the council members, represent all the citizens of the city, not just their own constituents, as Stacy Mongeau pointed out. She actually those were thoughts that I had. And I can't see your timing, somebody sitting in front of it there. Okay. So JetBlue has been a proud partner to this city and they've done a lot for the city and they've not done damage to the city. And they are simply asking to have flights that will go to Mexico possibly, and it will not enlarge anything at the airport. I would just ask Councilman Austin and your anger to consider some kind of compression of the time period or if there's a way the staff can be given working on the studies even before the April election. That would be a great help. And also, I'm not quite sure city manager were the three year period. What's that's comprised of. And perhaps at some point you could explain why it's going to take three years. Thank you, sir. Time time's all up. Thank you. Okay. Thank you so much. Next speaker. Good evening, honorable mayor and members of the Council, Kurt Gaston, president of the Long Beach Airport Association. Thank you for taking the time tonight to discuss and receive our all of our comments on both sides. Of this issue. On the motion before you on behalf of the Board of the directors of the Long Beach Airport Association. And the airport business. Community. We again are here to confirm our unanimous support of the city's airport noise ordinance. We support your effort. To conduct the required due diligence on the. Facts that we believe support. Permitting. Permit international operations at the airport consistent with the provisions provided by the ordinance and slot allocation process. We appreciate the due diligence you need to receive in order to properly. Vet out and improve international flights. However, we ask you tonight not to unreasonably delay the process that will provide you those facts. But instead provide a 60 day window. Of time that will both permit the fourth District Council seat to be filled while providing staff the opportunity to finalize or prepare the required due diligence as a roadmap for you to consider all the specific and relevant details and facts. During this time, the candidates for the fourth District can participate and will be. Able to review the relevant facts and attend any community briefings. So that at the end of the 60 day. Period, the formal application. Can be submitted to this. Council for their review and action. Please do. Not consider further restricting use as an operational activities at the airport. That would. Be permitted under that noise ordinance. So that noise levels would be artificially kept below. That which is permitted. And any. International flight operations will only use existing. Slots, gates. Parking positions and no new passenger holding rooms. The arrival and destination. Locations for. Aircraft that will bring. Commerce, jobs and economic opportunity into the city in no way restrict or eliminate your opportunity or obligation as well as ours to manage and mitigate airport noise by enforcing without any fear what has and should be and continue to be a healthy, well defended policy. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. My name is Jane Naito. I'm a resident of the eighth District and have been since 1998. Mayor and City Council Members. You were all elected by the residents of Long Beach to represent their concerns and needs. Currently, the fourth District has no representation. In fairness to them, I strongly urge you to withhold any discussion or review of JetBlue's request for a Customs facility until after a fourth District Council person is in place. I know a plane flying from Mexico to Dallas makes no difference in the noise ordinance. I know that JetBlue is currently not using all the slots allotted to them, so the noise level is reasonably quiet. I know that the minimum 41 commercial flights are signed and that only six of the 25 commuter flights slots are now being utilized. What I don't know is if adding a customs facility to the Long Beach airport will invite the FAA and other airlines to challenge our current operation. I was part of the neighborhood group that challenged the city and business entities relating in 1923 against quadrupling the size of the airport to satisfy JetBlue. Thanks to our efforts, we have a beautiful airport that everybody loves. In addition to waiting until we have a fourth District Council member, I urge you to instruct city staff not to have any more closed door meetings with JetBlue. Some discussions have already occurred, and this is why it's raised the level of concern in the neighborhoods. We would love the opportunity to work with city staff and the Council on projects that impact us instead of finding out later what has been decided. Please consider the concerns and needs of the neighborhoods and the residents that voted you in office before the concerns and desires of JetBlue. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Good evening, Mayor Garcia and members of the council. My name is Rob Mitchell and I'm manager of government and airport affairs for JetBlue Airways, which is based here in Long Beach at the airport. Two weeks ago, my colleague Rob Land, our senior vice president for government affairs, stood before you and expressed JetBlue's continued and longstanding support for the sanctity of the noise ordinance that governs operations at the airport. The request JetBlue submitted recently was a direct ask of the city to begin a process of fact finding due diligence and discussion. With the letter we submitted, JetBlue is not asking for nor expecting the imminent arrival of international flights at the airport next week. Similarly, with the request we submitted, we were not expecting the study of a reasonable, modest addition to the capabilities of the airport to be postponed for 90 days after the next councilperson from the fourth District is seated. Something that would take us to the end of summer before any work could begin, let alone a decision be made at acquisition of a customs facility at the airport will take staff work by the city. The motion before the council tonight prohibits staff from doing exactly what they are tasked to do all of the homework and due diligence in order to bring it back to council. For a policy decision later, staff needs to have to begin to have these discussions with engineers, architects and the operations team. How it is financed needs to be investigated. And then after all that, the Council must submit a request to and receive approval from the Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection before a lengthy construction project could commence. If this Council wishes to delay a request made by a solid corporate citizen and a request only to begin a process for as much as 4 to 6 months without any justification, then it certainly shouldn't. It should should not stand in the way of the enormous research, due diligence and fact finding the city needs to undertake. JetBlue strongly supports that any delay this council votes on tonight explicitly avoid delaying the start of this critical investigatory work. The airport manager has a request from the majority tenant at the airport and undertaking the work I have described in no way rushes this process, nor does it force this council to act one way or another . If the city truly wants to be an international city, a progressive city, and a pro-jobs city, it must at least explore all the opportunities to do so. Long Beach has has has long been and will continue to be an airport with tight restrictions and a flight ordinance that enforces tight restrictions on flights. And we believe the airport is simply being utilized far less than these limitations currently announced allow. I urge the Council not to support the unnecessary delay and allow staff to begin the much needed work right away and shorten the minimum timeframe for which it can be allowed to come back to the council. Thank you very much. Mr. Mayor. Council members. My name's Joe Miller. I'm the chair of the Los Altos Center, adjacent neighborhoods in the fourth District. And I can't tell you how many hours I've spent in this chamber dealing with airport issues over the years. Long time before most of you have been here. And I can tell you that this is a very important issue for the fourth District, the fourth District residents. This is the thing that unites them as a community is their concern over the airport. And it's something that our councilman and now Assemblyman Patrick O'Donnell understood. In fact, that's one of the reasons he was elected, is because our former councilperson did not understand that. And that's one reason he was elected. And for him to reach out to you from Sacramento on this issue is very, very important. And no one understands the fourth District right now more than Councilman and now Assemblyman O'Donnell. And the fact that he's reached out to you is very important. And I can tell you from my neighborhood, this is very, very important to our neighborhood. And as the JetBlue person said, we want to be a progressive city. We also want to be a Democratic city. And we really don't have a voice here. And as other people have said, we really don't have anyone who is accountable to us. You know, Patrick would pick up the telephone, call us, talk to the neighborhood leaders, just as I'm sure many of you do to your own neighborhood leaders. None of you have my phone number. None of you can reach out to the neighborhood leaders in the fourth District, and we really need that. The other thing that Patrick did when the airport size was being debated, he worked with the other council people to come up with that. We don't have someone to work with you right now. We don't have a voice to to tell you our concerns. We know that you talk to each other and you meet with each other. You you do that. We need someone on behind the dais doing that for all of us in the fourth District. And believe me, it is very, very important to all of us in the fourth District. That's why I'm here tonight, to ask you to please support Councilman Austin and councilman during this motion. And thank you both for bringing it forward. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Mayor and City Council. My name is Richard Ivey. I live at 242 East Bixby Road. I'm president of the Las Vegas Neighborhood Association. I love our city. I love Long Beach. When I was a student at Cal State, Long Beach, the professor would have to stop class twice an hour to wait for the planes to go over . I thank you, Mr. Austin, as and Mr. Durango, both representing our neighborhood in both the seventh and eighth districts. For your stance here tonight and how important this is. This is something that our noise ordinance is extremely fragile. And the impact that this could have if. Planes decide to come in here because it's convenient and it opens up an opportunity to mess with the noise ordinance, which I don't think the citizens of Long Beach fully understand how big a decision this is. If you mess with that noise ordinance, you could be looking at 100 to 130 flights a day. And I don't think the citizens of Long Beach. Are aware of how serious this issue is. And I would just ask that you not mess with it. Thank you. Next week, the police. Good evening. My name is Bill Goodell Outdoor. I reside in the eighth district, four, four, six five Cerritos Avenue. And I'm here to support Councilmember your ongoing Austin's motion or agenda item. Thank you for bringing it forward. I wanted to address a couple of things, specifically that Councilwoman Manga Mongo said earlier. You said that you're used to yourself as representing the whole city. I accept that. And you also said you represent the businesses and since the airport is in your business, then this district, that means JetBlue is your constituent. Correct? Okay. So basically, you you represent JetBlue among all of you guys. That would be your constituent. So I understand that seems logic to me. Well, they don't get to vote no. Maybe not with their voices, but with something else. Anyway, I didn't want no, I didn't want I didn't want this. I didn't want that. This reality. Sorry. Guys. Let's just try to. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. But anyway, I think it's reasonable to for you to suggest let's let's just keep the process going. Let's start the process. You said it's a three year process or. The three year plan. You forget that it's already been going on since over two years. City manager has said that there has been private discussions with city council members. Some of you, maybe not. All of you, but there has been discussion. The process has been going on for over two years and maybe just another five months, and it's going to be completed. And for this to continue without the representation of the fourth District is just not responsible at all. You're suggesting that what? Just finished a process? We need all the facts. We'll get the facts in five months. We'll have the new councilmember here and we'll bring her or him up to speed. I would suggest that it's going to require a lot more than bringing her or him up to speed. You need to think of this person needing to be in the process. If the people of the fourth district really are going to be represented, their representative needs to be in the process from the beginning as much as possible to the end, not just be brought up to speed. Thank you. Thank you very much. Next speaker, please. Good evening, Mr. Mayor and council members, Darryl Supernova, resident of the fourth District. Thank you for bringing this motion forward. Councilmembers Austin and Ranga after the study session on the 17th. I saw the mayor in the next day and I compliment him on his handling of one of the questions. And I said, You know what? I really like the way you reacted. You got out in front of it. You owned it. You addressed the fact that the city had made a mistake and talked to the city manager. You referenced him and said it was a personal. Issue and we took care of it. So first, I'd like to compliment. You, Councilmember, for getting out in front of this issue, owning it and putting it in front of the people. Also to I'll just react to a couple of things that were said. Council Member Mungo, thank you for taking up the slack. And to your staff, we are out a snow day. But again, she does not have a vote. So that's the issue here. Finally, there was a previous. Speaker said there's some type of question about the three year time frame. I just referenced our previous airport director said there was a three year frame. Our current airport director says. There's a three year time frame. These are the. Experts. And in today's Language. Business Journal, I think there's. An online edition. Now, Dave Willunga has. An article that. Has that same quote. So I just want to clear clarify that point. Thank you very much. Thank you. Next speaker, please. I am Dr. Marshall Zamsky, 3917 Linden Avenue. And I wanted to definitely support Al Austin and Roberta Yar'adua's motion. I think it's very important. My concern is that we elected you guys. And to be on the council to represent us and yet the world. The wheels have been turning for an awful long time and it seems to me that the foundations of our country are based on democracy, and yet our city council doesn't seem to have almost any input into the process. So my feeling is that to support this this motion and to say that the city council should be involved at every point and be able to veto anything just because one big corporation wants some wants to muscle their way around here. It shouldn't be. It shouldn't be allowed. And that isn't what we elected our representatives, our city councilors to do. So anyway, that's. I just wanted to say that. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Next speaker. Yes. Joe Sopel. You have my address on file, Mr. Mayor. City Council members. Alan Roberto, thank you very much for bringing this forward. It's been said in here that we're going to give time for the candidate, whoever is elected, to be brought up to speed. But the truth. Is, none of you are up to speed. You know, we fought this a decade or so ago. And coincidentally, the same people who were saying build it, build a build it are the same people here who have stood in front of you tonight and two weeks ago and said, Oh, yeah, we need international flights. It's a good idea. What's a good idea for JetBlue? If I was, JetBlue would be the thing I would be doing international flights. In fact, JetBlue has been working behind your backs. It's been going on for at least the last year. They've been talking to city staff. They've been talking to other council members who want to listen to them. But really, it's been behind staff. Why is this such a good idea? We've got LAX, we've got John Wayne. What we have is one hell of a great municipal airport. We fought for it. We didn't want it to be industry standards. We want it to be what it is. That was the key word. Industry standards quadruple the size. A previous airport advisor president stood up in front of you a little while ago and said, it's not expansion. It's not going to get any bigger. The truth is, it will get bigger. There is more square footage going to be added. They've got to build a terminal for international flights. They can't do it out of what we have. That's just not going to happen. We can't afford it. Our our airport is perfect. It's a perfect. Relationship. Don't screw. With it. Leave it alone. We've got something good. Tackle the big, big issues like the marijuana issue or downtown. We've got plenty of issues to tackle. You know, there's quite a few people in here holding signs right now. Back in the old days, we used to fill every seat with a sign. And people were really upset and they had a lot of energy. And that's what's going to happen again if you proceed on this. Now, we're just talking about a little study. It's referred to as the the camel getting its nose under the tent. That's what we're talking about. I'm a salesman. I know when you're not going a door and you want to get in there, what you do is put your toe in there, you put your knee in there, get your butt in there, and then you're into that door. Don't let JetBlue do that. They can wait because whatever decisions you do make is going to last for a very, very long time. Don't be rushed. Thank you. Thank you, Joe. Next speaker, please. Larry, would you click as the address? I do not live in the fourth district, but let me say this. I've been very impressed with the counsel position from the ninth District. And when our good councilman Price becomes mayor, maybe in eight years or with luck, maybe even sooner. All right. Depending upon how fast in the Ninth Circuit Court moves. All right. Consider moving into the third district with very sharp mind. I like your approach. I see. This is one. If this project goes through regardless of its merits. It'll obviously as the last speaker been mentioned, it's going to be there for ages. All right. So the barn on this issue is a barn. It clearly is not on fire. Absolutely. So take the time to review it thoroughly. In respect to Councilperson Mungo's. Volunteering to vote for that district, giving her background. The people need to feel they are represented 100%. And as one who lives in a third district, I would take great umbrage of somebody coming in from another area that had not studied as well and is very familiar with anything related to Alameda Play or the Marine Stadium. That's not to say that your work is not appreciated. But the fact is, these people deserve to have someone there that is their official representative. Who they can hold responsible. For whatever vote, whichever way that person votes. Thank you. Thank you, Larry. Next speaker, please. Cecelia Leach. Seventh District 3645 Myrtle Avenue. Thank you, Mr. Mayor, and all the council members for listening to all of our comments. I want to thank council members Austin and Ranga for putting this motion. Forward, which I strongly support as well. It seems to me that one option that hasn't yet been discussed is the option of not moving forward at all. And while. There while. Some may oppose, some may support that option, so far, the JetBlue representatives appear to be saying that this would simply delay the process and assume that. The entire process would go forward. I think that that is not, as other speakers have mentioned, a democratic process. And we need to have all options on the table and we need to have all of the city council members here. To discuss those options. I also. Just want to register some surprise at Councilmember Mango's assertion that supporting this would be pandering to. Those of us. Who are citizens with signs in the audience of which I am one, which seems to be. Contradictory. To her. Statement that she represents the entire city. Thank you. Yes. If you like. Speaker, please. Hello. Good evening. Hello. Hi, Mayor. It's been a while. Mayor Garcia? Yes. And council members first. You know, I had something very nice and calm to read to you, but I have to make a comment on some of the discussion that was going on earlier when Claudia and Mr. West said that there was no study going on right now. That's a key word right now. There were actually two studies done. One was presented to the council, and I'm not sure what happened to the other one. For Askar and Associates presented in November of 2013 and the Megadeal Economic Study made comments that wouldn't support any further economic development of the city. Both of them stated minimal economic impact. Mr. West I'm going to say that you should have asked the Council if they were interested in moving forward with this in 2013. They have been operating behind the scenes, doing studies, meeting with Homeland Security, taking it, doing term sheets and and lots of communication going in this direction while the neighborhoods have been sitting back there not understanding what was coming forward. So with that, that's that's my rant. And now I would like to say the nice things that I have to say, and that is to acknowledge that every district in our city deserves a leader that can advocate on their behalf, especially when such serious commitments are being considered. That's good leadership, and it's also the right thing to do. Imagine if the First District had not had representation over Pier J. The Green Port Policy, the Middle Harbor or other mega influencing projects from the Port of Long Beach that have daily impacts on Long Beach residents. If the Second District was not represented in discussions on our downtown plan, Civic Center ideas or the Entertainment District Studies, if the third district leadership was vacant without direction on the wetlands development, the second and PCH controversial plans, the Belmont Plaza Pool or the Naples seawalls, the fifth District. As homogenous as it appears, houses one of the most controversial aspects of our city, our airport, just as the port and the downtown belongs to everyone, regardless of their home district. So does the airport, which lies in the center of some of our most successful neighborhoods. The the fifth has been faced with challenges with the transfer of McDonnell Douglas to Boeing, the massive reductions of Boeing, and then, of course, the direction of the Boeing development would take what it would take to best benefit and protect Long Beach and its citizens, the sixth District. It's a challenged community that bears the scars of poverty and the reputation of being outcast. Without a dedicated community person to lead, would they have found the solution to the loss of the Kroc Center at Shattuck Field or seen positive development within and around Cambodia town, the seventh District? In many ways a tale of two cities without a leader to champion the 710 expansion plan or the up and coming skate project. What would those neighborhoods be confronted with today? Ray I. Got a. Are you going to make me stop before I get to the district? It's not you know, I can I know I have to follow I have to follow the. Rules, actually. You know, the rules do allow you to to give me 30 seconds. Right. But I'll tell you what, I don't have to go. What I'm going to do is as a as a as a deference. You are a former member of this body. I will let you finish, but I'd want the public to know that generally if it wasn't because you're in a formal council, it's very difficult to continue. So please continue. I appreciate that, Mayor. Our eighth district representatives have always been required to educate and lead our city when it comes to issues related to our Long Beach airport. Imagine if there had not been an ED toddler, Jeff Kellogg on board to provide direction. Thank you, Al. And thank you, Roberto, for taking the lead on this. And then finally, the ninth District, much like the sixth uptown, has felt isolated and ignored for many, many years without the leadership and vision of Jerry Schultz, Val Lurch, Steve Neal and now Rex Richardson. What would the conditions be up there today? Together. The nine districts make up our vibrant, diverse city of Long Beach. What happens to one district will eventually in some way impact the others, creating ample time for the next fourth district councilperson to settle in. Allows time for each one of you to better understand the history of our airport. Where I got. To. It gives you time. It gives you time to consider the pros and cons and the benefits and the risks. Thank you very much. Thank you very. Next speaker. Hello. My name is Richard Lindemann. I'm running for the fourth District Council seat. My address is 1605 Ohio Avenue. And I want to thank Alison. And Roberto Urunga for bringing forth this measure. And I think. Either 90 days or 60 days is probably a good thing. And I'll give part of my. Time to her so. It'll it'll work out okay. But I really appreciate it. And I think I truly think that we need to have a voice on the on the council. So I hope that you do pass this. And safety measure for us. Thank you. Thank you for your work. And I if there's anyone else wants to speak, I'm going to close the speakers list with you. If you're not up to the podium, please. No. Okay. I'm going to close I'm going to close the speakers list. You're our last speaker. Please begin. Hi. My name is Robert Casado. I live on a 2235 Miramar Avenue. I'm in the fifth District. Thank you for increasing the wattage on our lights on our street. We really appreciate that. I don't have any stats or any numbers here to show you or. To give you. What I do have is a love for aircraft. I grew up in La mirada, close to Fort and airport, always listening to private planes fly over. There was always air shows. I lived in Torrance for a while, close to Zamperini airfield, which was wonderful because there's always small aircraft flying Long Beach. I love Long Beach more than anything right now because it has a wonderful airport for short flights. For me, it's perfect. Sitting on my couch watching. TV, I can. Watch C-17s take off. I can watch F-18s go 500 miles an hour, pass the tower. I can watch. B-17s. B-29, super fortresses and any vintage aircraft fly over my house, you know, a few times a year. So my love for the aircraft, I turn into a schoolboy when I hear the radial engines of the Catalina airboats flying over just because it sounds different now, nobody does. That for 747 or 737. Or anything like that, because every jet engine like that of. That size sounds the same to me. My love for Long Beach is huge. I don't ever want to leave it. I love it so much. I love my fit district. I do a lot, but I honestly don't have. Any numbers or anything here that's substantial. Except for a love of the aircraft. If you add more aircraft, more large aircraft, you're taking away the airspace from our pilots who have private planes, small helicopters, and you're taking it away from our World War Two veterans who sometimes come to Long Beach in those World War Two aircraft they fought. And so by taking up that space, you're taking away the love that I have for everything that is Long Beach and JetBlue. You just lost a customer. Oh, okay. Thank you, sir. That that concludes our speakers list and certainly, I think everybody for giving their comments. So we're going to go back to the city council and just so that we get a reminder of where we're at. City Attorney There is a motion on the floor just as a reminder from Mr. Austin and Mr. Rangel, which is at present. Is that correct, sir? That's correct. Mayor. The motion on the floor, as I currently understand it, is and I'm not sure if the friendly amendment was accepted, but it would be to delay. Further action for the direction of City Council and direct city manager to delay any request for direction regarding a customs facility until either 90 days or 60 days after full representation . So this would require the city manager to put an item on the agenda after 60 days. The Councilmember for the fourth district is in their seat for 60 days. Okay. So that so I'm not I don't care who made that friendly to Councilman Pryce did. So I want to be sure we know where we're at before we continue the speaker's list here. So, Mr. Austin. Mr. Austin, are you accepting that friendly 90. You know what? I want to wait to hear from the rest of the council on this. Okay. We accept the friendly women. Okay. So then the motion on the floor is as presented just for the record then. So I have speakers list councilman mongo. So let's start out on a positive note. I want to promote that this weekend we are having a fly in the Ford event at the airport and I hope that each of you will take an opportunity to revisit and appreciate the airport as it is today. Even if the vote did not pass tonight, that means that this would still be. Delayed at least through the study process through at least August. I want to make a couple of quick comments. Once elected. Knowing the importance of this item, I quickly met with the advocates and adversaries of the airport, including the Honorable. Where did she go? Where did she go? There she is. And Joe Suppo. And since then I have met with Joe, who, while I do not have his phone number, we do email occasionally and. I want to say that I do listen to public comment, and I really appreciate the comment from Mario Cruz, because while I do feel that every vote I take is a big part of this city's future, I always have such a positive attitude. I never considered the fact that the fourth District couldn't recall me. But it is true, and I appreciate that component. And that being said. I also want to support the person who said that the fee for landing after hours is not enough. I constantly hear planes land after that hour. Every time a plane lands after that hour, I get a call from my mother, of which I remind her to call the noise hotline so that the airline has to pay a fee to the library. But I cannot increase that fee without causing potential risk to the noise ordinance. And so that is why we keep the status quo in regard to that component. If it were my choice, it would be five to 10 to $15000 per violation as it escalated with multiple. Issues. So let me let me offer a. A friendly amendment. I would like to have the study back and then I want 60 days because I want to use that 60 days to go into my community and have community meetings. And so having 60 days before nothing happens, which makes no sense because right now the city manager said he's not coming back until August. And so. That is significantly more time than is necessary for our colleagues to get up to speed. So what I would like to do is I would like the study to begin immediately and then I would like the two from four to the council so that and I would like it published publicly on the three website. So then I can email my mailing list, schedule one or two community meetings to hear how the communities which many of my community neighborhoods also fall in this district. And so then that would give me the time to go out and do the legwork. Because one of the things that really. Frustrated me about other items that come before this council is that they are given they give us ten days and ten days is not even enough time to get a community group together to discuss these kinds of matters. And so I think it's actually about the same amount of time that you are asking for, but in backwards order. Oh, no, no, no. Okay, I'm not. Hey, guys. I want to make sure that behind the dinosaur real quick. So just so I'm clear, Councilman Mango is asking for a friendly amendment to Councilman Austin. Councilor Brosnan. So Councilmember Mongeau, I do appreciate the the brainpower that you put toward this and the willingness to to kind of meet in the middle. But I don't see that as a friendly amendment. And I will tell you why, because the the intent here is to get a fourth District Council member seated and then have that person as part of the process. In terms of whatever study there is there, there are going to be points and issues that that that we deliberate as a city council to give direction to the city manager on. And so that is the intent of the the the motion here. I guess. Oh, don't clap yet. I guess the challenge for me on that is when the city management and the staff who we pay a great deal of money to and trust for, if we don't like what they do, we then have the opportunity to then remove that city manager. But I do put a lot of trust in them and the work that they do and they do gain direction. So I'm going to make a substitute motion that we begin the study and then the motion comes before council 60 days after that, so that I have time to go and reach into the communities and hear their feedback. Because while it's great to have a bunch of people come to council, I hear time and time again from the East Side that it is difficult for our parents and our soccer moms and all of the rest of them to make it down to City Hall on a Tuesday night at 5:00. And so I want to have those meetings in my community. Okay. Hey, guys. I want to make sure that we're we have a process that's respectful to it's hard to hear when there's people chatting. So I want to make sure that we're the council is able to deliberate fairly, but I want to make sure that I understand the substitute motion as I'm not sure. So the substitute motion was to begin the process of gathering the research now. And then the fourth district member sat and then six days after that, what exactly what happens? So I would like it to come as a two from four memo to the City Council posted on the website so that the community can deliberate for 60 days and discuss the ideas that are presented and or then make direction to the city manager to do additional studies. Because what I don't want is a bunch of meetings with no data. I don't think we can afford a customs terminal. I don't know where people think we're going to get ten, 20, $30 million. I don't know why there's a point of even discussing it if we don't know the facts behind it. So I would like the facts gathered. That's why. Okay. So there's. So just for the record, there's a substitute motion. And is there a second on the substitute? Yes, there's a second on the substitute. Vice Mayor Lowenthal. And now we're going to move on to the speaker's list, which we have. So we'll continue that. And ladies and gentlemen, I want to make sure that we got we are we want you to be respectful. The council was respectful when everyone spoke. I want to make sure that we're all respectful to this deliberation process. This is we go through this on every issue that is big. And it's very important to obviously all of you. But please give the council the respect that they so they can deliberate. I also want you all to hear the comments. So thank you, Councilwoman Pryce. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I. Want to reiterate that I support Councilmember Austin on this and I understand the intent behind it. One of my residents, Mr. Salt, spoke, and I respect him and I have incredible respect for him. But I wanted to talk a little bit about a few things that he said, because he is one of my residents and he's someone who has a great deal of experience with this. This is going to be a long term process. And I just think that there is no harm in waiting for our full body to be here as we start this process together. And I appreciate some of the comments that folks have made about, you know, you don't know the history. That's true. That's true. Certainly people with much more extensive experience and history of the airport could have run for office, but they're not here. So the reality is that, you know, we took the as glamorous as it may seem, the process of jumping out there and trying to serve our communities. And we are trying to educate ourselves and understand the history. And I'm meeting with anybody who wants to meet with me on this issue. I've been meeting with everybody. And and I'm going to continue to do that. But I want to make it very clear that there is nobody sitting up here that knows the third district the way I know the third district. There is nobody up here that cares about the third district the way I care about the third district. I wake up every morning, every day. I represent the entire city, but I know my district in and out and I know what those people need. And I'm going to always fight for them. I represent the entire city, but I think just because of the introduction that I've received of the fourth District, specifically their businesses in regards to the medical marijuana issue, that they currently feel a void in representation because they had a very strong advocate for a long time and they no longer have that person. And I think that is a very valid point. And I told Council member Austin from day one when we started talking about this, that I would support him on this. The reason I offered the friendly of 60 is to try to reach some middle ground so that we could be somewhat united as a council. I mean, that would be my hope because I'm going to tell you right now that and I appreciate the mayor clarifying that the issue before us tonight is when we're going to start this process. It's not the viability of an international terminal. I mean, it's not whether we like JetBlue or not. I fly JetBlue with my family. I think they've been incredible business partners. I don't think that's the issue tonight. I think the issue is when do we start this process? I, for one, am completely open to exploring the idea. I'm not against this idea. I'm open to exploring it and studying it. It's just a matter of when do we start that process? That is the limit of the discussion tonight. And we're talking about a three year process. I don't think 60 days or 90 days, I don't think is is any amount of time in the big scheme of things. I will say that one of the reasons I recommended 60 Days was because I feel that the authors of this item didn't feel that strongly about the 90 days to begin with, that they were open to considering a different timeline. It's not that they were steadfast on the 90 days, and so it was really is a point of compromise to try to get us all together. But you know what? We don't all have to be together. We don't all have to be united. That's okay. It's nice if we proceed that way, but that doesn't always work out. So that's my recommendation. I will be supporting Councilman Austin, and I would hope that he would consider the friendly amendment even if it doesn't result in consensus. I would hope that he would. I think 60 days is going to be enough time for our new council colleague to engage and meaningfully take this on. That's just my opinion. Thank you, Councilwoman. Next up is Vice Mayor Lowenthal. Okay. And so right now we have the substitute. Is that right? Councilmember Price. I think the comments that you had made, were you asking about a friendly to Councilmember Mango's motion? I are checking for clarification right now, but I had made a friendly and. Councilman Austin had said he would like to wait until he hears from his colleagues to decide whether he'd accept. Just a point of order. I don't believe I can accept that friendly right now. But should it come back and the motion before us fell on that friendly, we could definitely have a favorable conversation about a friendly amendment. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for that clarification. I want to thank Councilwoman Price for her comments. I agree with you. I'm not in favor of not seeking information. I do want to know and have this issue vetted. I think it needs to be vetted. But I also respect and value the opinions that you come to this council with tonight. While you might not be representative of the entire fourth District or fifth District or the entire city, you've taken the time to come out here. And and what I can hear is that you would like more time for this deliberation. I agree with that. At the same time, I also have never been in favor of stopping our insatiable quest for information, for knowledge. And I think that's part of why we're here as well. We're not here because we know all the answers or we have all the data I count on. And I think each council member counts on our staff and whomever the staff hires with council direction on the information that they bring back, there's just no way this is a part time council. And so I would be troubled if we actually put a halt to acquiring the knowledge. And so I'm not fearful of that. I'm not fearful of what the outcome might be. I actually like to more no more than less. And so, Councilmember Austin, given that this is something that you're working on, you feel very passionate about, each of us feels very passionately about it as well. I mean, none of us has a monopoly on any particular issue, but. Would you be open to? Councilmember Mango's motion, if I can recall it correctly, is to continue work. And have I believe she said have the two for from come back in 90 days would you be open to. No. Can you repeat that. The two four from would still take I think the city manager said five months. So that would be August and then that would give us time, 60 days, August and September to meet with our community. My fear is if we move this into the Christmas time, turnout from the community plummets. And so I was hoping to have really good, nourishing dialog with my constituents with facts in my hand. I don't want to have meetings that have no facts. And so I was just looking for data. And then 60 days, it actually comes out to the same or more time than our asked for, which is why I'm so confused of why the crowd didn't like it, because it it just makes no sense to me. I'm confused, I think probably because I was perhaps my being confused wasn't unique. Okay, now I understand that does sound like the right the same amount of time as Councilmember Austin had asked for. And so if we can focus on one key aspect that you raised, Councilmember Austin, which I think others have raised and concur with, is the seating of the Fourth District Council member. I believe it's very important. It's critical. And so if we can benchmark. Whatever motion it is to first that person being seated. But also make sure the staff doesn't stop its work. I'm what I don't want us to communicate is that we are afraid of continuing research and work. When the point of decision comes back, that council member will be here to provide direction, to provide input, to deliberate with the rest of us. We are not taking action. And so my question is, would you be open to a motion that whether it's council member Mungo's or your own, a motion that would ensure that the fourth District Council person is seated? Staff is able to continue its work that we are not putting a gag order on their due diligence, which is really in all of our best interest at least to have that knowledge. You don't have to act on the knowledge. I don't either. And then to determine a time frame when the item comes back after the person is seated, whether that's 60 days, 90 days, sometime before Christmas, I hope, because I agree. I think Thanksgiving to Christmas is an unfortunate time for policy items, but not for anything else. So would you consider that? The long and short answer is no because. Because the point, the spirit and intent of the agenda item was to halt any work that has been done up to this point. You know, I think it's important for the city council to have input in on the direction on how we move forward. We just got a letter last week from Jet Blue, right. Asking us to move forward again. They are asking us to move forward. Not compelling us, not pushing us. There's nothing in their letter that says we have to move forward at all. Be quite honest with you. So. So I like Councilmember Pryce and many other council members. I'm open to hearing the case, but I don't think we should be committing any more staff resources because we've already committed quite a bit up to this point without council direction. We need to make sure that there is clear council direction on how we move forward and proceed forward. And a fourth district representative needs to be seated. For us to do that. Okay. I know. They surprise me a little. So thank you, Councilmember Austin. I think that's. I'm I'm glad I asked the question and I have that clarification from you. For the most part, I agree with you. I mean, I'm not in agreement over staff stopping work. So if I can ask, Mr. West, what is this work that just I know you've said it a couple of times, but please reiterate it for me. What is this work that you're doing? I think it's clear that back in 2013, JetBlue approached our current airport director, Mario Rodriguez, and there were discussions. There were two memos that were sent to the city council regarding those discussions. At that time, there was a lot of things happening in the city where the Civic Center going. We had a lot of stuff going on at Tidelands. So I directed Mr. Rodriguez just to stop and let's wait until we cleared our plate a little bit to go forward. A few months later, Mr. Rodriguez left us for another position, and then we made the decision. I made the decision informing the council that we weren't going to take this up until Mr. Francis was seated. So Mr. Francis is seated. So this brings us to where we're at today. So at this stage, what we would do with the council direction would go hire an expert firm in the customs arena, and they would work with us to provide us the metrics where we could come to the city council and let you know whether this is something that can possibly be done financially. Can it be done administratively? Can it be done operatively? Can it be done geographically? Where would you put it and how would it operate and all that? Again, this would not carry any recommendation whatsoever. If we found out early on that it doesn't make financial sense. If it doesn't make financial sense, we wouldn't go forward with it. But after a five month period with this consultant looking at industry standards for airports and look at airports of our size throughout America that have done this kind of stuff, then in five months, we'd given that study to the city council. Then the city council would discuss that study and what to do with it. Okay. Thank you. So I would like to make a substitute. Substitute motion. And that motion would be to start the process or continue the process, as Mr. West has indicated, and come back in 90 days after the council district. I'm sorry, after the member of the council. It's a little late night after the fourth District Council member is seated. It's not. Okay. So, guys, ladies. Gentlemen, I can't continue that. Please. I just want to make sure we're being respectful. That's a different motion than the original motion. So I just want to make sure that we're being respectful. The difference and the key difference of that motion and the original motion. Correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. City Attorney, is that Mr. Austin's original motion would come back for an affirmative vote of the council before automatically moving forward. Is that is that correct? That's correct. The original motion asked for direction from the council prior to beginning the study is described. So that's that's a very different motion. So I just want to make sure that that we're very clear. Okay. So we have now a a substitute substitute. Is there a second on the substitute substitute? Okay. There is a second. Can you. Okay, so let me just get clarity. You got how many? How much time is this? 90 days after the person is seated in the fourth district. So the way I see this before. I mean. Well, hold on, Councilman. You're next on the Q. So, no, I don't I'm not I have questions about her motion. You can you can go into it because you're next on the Q. So I'm tracking this. So it looks like Councilman Austin's motion says, okay, folks, get seat in two months in the fourth District. Correct. And 30 days after the election, they'll get seated. Right? They'll get seated. They won't get seated the day they're elected. It's when they get seat. Two months from now, they get seated. Then three months it would come back to the council after after 90 days per your motion, it will come back to the council. So that puts us at five months. Okay. Or friendly 60. And then it and then it says five months later, there will be. That's how long it takes for the study to be concluded. The correct city manager. Five months. The study would take approximately five months. So five months. My calculation that puts us January 2016 is ten months from now. That puts us in January. Councilmember Vice Mayor, where does your so yours has us in 30 days. Know it? How many days after the election? 90. So 90 days after the two months it takes for the person. Not after the election. After they're seated. So after they're seated. Correct. They'll be seated in May. So that puts us at five months from now. So five months from now, that puts us in one August. So the question between the two motions are when the city council gets a vote on it. August or December. And the key difference between the two, I think, is it's also when staff would actually begin the data collection piece and so on. On Councilman Austin's motion, the data collection would not begin until sometime a few a couple of months after the council person is seated. But for that data collection to begin, it would first require a affirmative vote of the city council. The difference with Vice Mayor Lowenthal is motion is the motion. Would the process for the city manager would begin now, which, according to the city manager would take approximately five months. And so that the that the couple of months after the person is seated would fall around five months. And so it would be around the the August time period. So that's I think that's the difference. Here's here's the challenge that I want to I want to get to a place. I'm hoping that we can get to a place. And I understand you have a motion. And because I have the floor, I could second it. But I want to see if things are still malleable. Here's here's what I'd like to see. There's the difference between the two or is a difference of five months. And I need to have an understanding, like right now, the way I see this is very the council's very divided. I'd like to see if there's some middle ground and see if there's a place, if Councilmember Alston, like what do you really want to get out of this? Do you want to get this? January 2016 is where you want to take up this issue. Is that what you're trying to get to or in council vice chair more so I see this timeline is the same timeline that the that the city manager put forth. If he were to start today, it would take five months. So five months from today would be essentially the same timeline. So we've got a five month gap and I don't want to be in a place where we're being divisive. Let's meet in the middle. That's my that's what I'm offering to be meet in the middle. One person is saying January, another person is saying August, meet in the middle. Is that possible? There's no substitute substitute right now. You have a substitute. You can change it to meet in the middle. If I hear from Councilmember. Actually, just to clarify, let me clarify. I have the. Floor. There. No, let me clarify that. Is this a substitute substitute motion? There was a substitute motion by Councilwoman Mongeau. I understand we're talking about the substitute. Which has a sup which has a second. It has a second. It does have a second. It does. But I'm still listening, though. I am still listening, thinking I'm sorry I don't have. The I want to get to a place where honestly there's going to be a discussion about the international airport and we will have to take an up and down vote on it. And what we're talking about right now is whether we have when we take that vote between August and January and honestly, the ninth District, I said it earlier, we're not in the flight path. I want to be neighborly. I think there were some good concerns today about the fourth District not being seated. I would hate for those things to happen. I feel that everybody on the council here feels the same way. So what I'm trying to get to is I want to debunk and get past all the high energy here and get to a compromise. Can you guys meet in the middle? Mr. Mayor, may I just give a quick response to that? Absolutely. So what is really important for me is to not stop our learning process and to not stop acquisition of information. That's that's important to me. I'm troubled by our direction that we stop staff from doing their work or the work that I trust them to do. I have many items on my policy plate that I'm not ready to take a position on today, but my staff is still vetting it. They're not waiting until I'm ready to take a vote and things take years. And so that's my most important aspect to this motion, is not to stop staff work. I think that's irresponsible. I understand. So what I'm trying to hope I'm just driving a conversation that hopes hopefully gets to a meeting in the middle and if there's any, that's what I want to get to. If if I'm I hope that we can have that conversation here and then I'm not forced to be in a place where I have to pick between the airport and the community. I think we can be reasonable and we can get to this point. And and you guys all control the motion. I can take no action right now, which is what I would have done, but I can't take any action. So this is ultimately up to all of you, and I hope that you get there. Okay. Thank you. I may turn this back to the next speaker, which is Councilmember Austin. Yes. Thank you. And and as I predicted, this would get caught up in the friendlies the most and substitutes and substitute substitutes. And this is normal par for the course for this council. I appreciate the everybody trying to get somewhere. I want to be very clear. I work for the city of Long Beach. I represent the residents of Long Beach, not Jet Blue. And I'm not compelled to to move their agenda tonight without a sport district representative seated. This is about process. And what the the current motion fails to do is fails to give the city, the fourth district representative, a voice at the table. The item that I brought forth would. Halt the process. It would wait until there's an election. But it would also bring this item back before the city council and allow the city council to be part of the discussion in terms of process moving forward. We would give direction there. The way this is now is allow staff to just do what they do, you know, and have their own process without our input. And I think that's wrong. So I would really ask this this council to step up and understand that that moving forward would be irresponsible and, in my opinion, undemocratic if we were to to vote on it in favor of the substitute substitute motion or the substitute motion. I want to get back to the original motion and the intent of what we came here to do tonight night. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I have so I have I have two more speakers. And then we're going to go back to the motions, which of which there are three on the floor. And I will repeat those and make clear clarify those before we move forward. Next up, I have Councilwoman Mango. Thank you. Councilmember Richardson, my motion is in the middle. And let me tell you why. My motion gives us information by which we can vet with our community to come back to the council in November, which is between August and January. And at that time, we can give direction for additional information or not. But what I don't want is for us to come back in 90 days to give direction to the city manager with no more information than we have tonight. And that's that's where I'm stuck again. I'm not here to advocate for one side or the other. What I'm here to advocate for is information and a place in the middle. And so. If if that met what Councilmember Richardson was thinking and hopefully meets what everyone else is thinking, then maybe we'll vote down the substitute. Substitute and get to the substitute. Just a thought. Okay. And the final speaker we have council. Council member. You're Ranga. And then we're going to go to the substitutes motions and go down the go down there. So consider your anger. Okay, so now I'm all confused. No, I'm only kidding. Basically, what it comes down to is not. Whether we continue forward or hold it for longer or cut it shorter or initiate a process or not. What it's all about and what our original motion was or is, because it's still there on the table. Is to wait until a fourth district representative is seated. At that point, we start the process of informing staff or giving staff direction about how we want to study conducted. It's a council driven process as opposed to a staff driven, driven process. We provide we provide guidance and direction to staff as to what we want to see in this study. That's why we wanted to have to wait for a election to take place with a person to get seated, to get acclimated, and then once that happens, start giving direction to staff. What we want to see in the study, whether it's what's the effects going to be on the noise ordinance, what the effect is going to be in the flight, on the number of flights, all of that. Because that fourth district representative is going to have to have all that information in order to make a responsible, sound, informed decision. And if we and if we say that, okay, we do it now. Start the process now. That's a staff driven process. That's not what we're after. What we're after is a council driven process. And that's where we have to take control here behind these, not over there, with all due respect to my colleagues. So that's where I want to go back to my origin. Our original motion is to wait for the 90 days. If it's 60, fine, but 90 days after the person is seated so that that individual can become part of the process and helping to direct staff how we want the study conducted. Thank you. And I. I have one. I think I have one final person cued up. And then, Councilor Richardson, did you queue up again? So. That's right. I'm the guy who didn't want to talk about this. So. So. So I'm just I'm. I won't. I hoped that we got to a place that it was like a meeting in the middle, because at the end of the day, like, the council is going to have to vote on this how to vote on this airport, the motion that's on the floor. It doesn't take me where I want to go. I'm not going to be supporting that motion. And and I think so. I'm not going to be supporting that. And I appreciate Councilmember Mungo's suggestions. I would be open to considering that if, you know, I, I want to get to that point where we can talk about it, because it seems like there's been like maybe one or two people talking compromise, maybe three people in the council talking compromise. And we need to at least I think there's there's some entrenched sides here. And I think we need to get to the folks in the middle to make this motion. So that's where I want to be. So I won't be supporting the motion on the floor. Okay. Now I'm going back to I have I have summary low and thought of cued up. There you go. So if I hear you correctly, Rex, I think you're right. There are several of us here and probably all of us that would like to work toward a compromise. This isn't something that should be. Bare minimum votes. And so I'm willing to withdraw my motion and I will be supporting Councilmember Mango's substitute motion. Can I do that, miss? Yes. We're just. We're. Madam Clerk. We're going to go ahead and withdraw the. The substitute. Substitute? And now we have a substitute motion on the floor, which is the manga motion. Okay. Correct. Okay. I'm going to restate it for you forward. Vice President, are you out? Do you have anything additional? No. So it doesn't have names next to the substitute, do they? Thank you. Mongo and Lowenthal. Okay. Thank you. Now, I'm going to go before I move on to Councilman Price, who's next cued up. We are on the substitute motion and I'm going to have Mr. Sinatra. Do you want to repeat the motion for the council? MAYOR Members of the council. The substitute motion, I believe, made by Council District five and second by Council District two was to direct the city manager to begin the study immediately. And that process would take approximately five months at the conclusion of the study. The study would then be provided to the Council in a memo form to be published on the city website and then would be brought back to the council 60 days after it's published. Okay. That's the substitute motion on the floor. I do have a short speakers list. I'm going to get through that. Councilman Price. I guess the trouble I'm having is. What. Are we foreclosed from doing? Outreach with our communities if we wait 60 days or 90 days? I mean, I guess that's what I don't understand. So for me, I feel like the staff is going to be doing their work. And unless I've missed something, it's not like they're going to be reporting back to us regularly such that we have this updated information. I think they're saying it's going to take them about five months to do their study and their their research and what they have to do. So I don't know that we would have actual, tangible information any way to do outreach with the community. So for me, you know, I would like to do outreach with the community as well. I just you know, in the big scheme of things, I just don't think we're talking about that much time. And I've communicated this to people that are proponents of moving this forward is that I don't know that this is the battle that's worth the fight right now, because all we're asking for is a little bit of time to allow the fourth district representative to be involved in the process. Let's say, for example, that staff starts this process and there is a legitimate concern or idea. I mean, sometimes my council colleagues have great ideas that I didn't think about. They're brilliant in many ways. And so and sometimes they highlight things that I would have never thought about. Let's say our new councilperson has an idea or thought of something they'd like the staff to explore or look into that they know is going to affect them. Or of course, they'll have the opportunity to do that after the study is done. But to me, it makes sense for them to be involved in the process like we are. We're all involved in the process together. And so I don't think we're foreclosed from doing outreach and doing that meaningful community outreach when we if if we wait. That's that's all I'm saying. I might be missing something here. I just I guess what I'm and perhaps it's because I don't know the history. To me, it seems like this is not an unreasonable request for for a delay. I just it seems reasonable to me under the circumstances. So with that. Thank you, Councilwoman Price, Councilmember Austin. Starting the work. Again. I'd just like to first of all, thank all of the people who have endured and stay with this all night here. Obviously, this is an important issue and the council is giving it the the time it deserves and the thought it deserves moving forward. I'm going to go back to the original intent here. And again, I think council member Urunga summed it up best. This is a we're trying to accomplish a council driven agenda here on on anything moving forward with the customs facility at Long Beach Airport. Again, the staff has been working on this issue for close to two years. There has been feasibility studies that I see you shaking your head. Council, I mean, City Manager West. Can you tell us how much has been currently committed in terms of resources to to to this to this to this effort? I can't tell you entirely, because the resources committed. Were back in October and November of. 2013, as I mentioned, because we had so much on our plate after we brought the memos to the city council's attention regarding the work that Mr. Rodriguez was doing with Jet Blue. I personally made the decision because our workload was so tight to just stop this until we until we had some time to put some time into it, get to the city council. At that time, Mario then decided to leave. I pointed Reggie Harrison with the same direction to not engage JetBlue, not to process this. So I can affirmatively tell the city council with, with all due respect, that no work on this has been done since November 13. Okay. Well, that's what we're showing. And thank you for that clarification. There was a feasibility study done. There was a consultant hired to do that feasibility study. That feasibility study is available as public record as I believe. And so to to satisfy somebody's insatiable quest for knowledge that our council and council colleagues may have. There is some information out there and there has been work done. Again, we are trying to get to a point where this is a council driven situation where we can eliminate all of the the the the the conspiracies out there. We can do this in a transparent way. The process will be clear. And so, therefore, I'd like to offer a substitute substantive motion to incorporate the original motion, but ensure that. That after 60 days the city council can provide is is in a position where after 60 days the city council can provide city manager direction on how to proceed forward with the request for international customs facility. Okay. Mr. City, attorney. Mayor and members of the council that I don't see any distinction between your original motion, which requires the city manager. Well, let me. Clarify let me clarify that. Let me clarify myself. The two steps to motion will ask for 67 days as opposed to 60. That that wouldn't be a substantial change in order to make it. Well. The original motion was 90 days. So I think the substitute substitute motion incorporates the friendly and we'll days to 60 days. The question on the floor would have been, had you already accepted the friendly amendment and you had he mentioned a couple of times he. Has not accept the fact. No. Can I be heard on that? Real quick. Just real quick. So I'm sure there's a back over to the person who has the floor. But that fully amendment was not accepted by the councilmember yet. Councilmember Austin, Susie Price had a point of view. Do you have a point of order? Well, I do, actually. When I originally made the friendly councilman, Austin accepted the friendly at that time. And as he did, he talked about how when he and Councilman Councilmember Urunga were discussing this agenda item, they talked about the 90 days, but that they weren't completely I'm in court all day long so I can transcribe things like it's nobody's business. He talked about how they they have they talked about the 90 days. They weren't tied to the 90 days. They thought that that was overly ambitious and that 60 days seemed reasonable. In my opinion, that was an acceptance of the friendly when then we did some confusing things. But when it came back to him, he said, I want to hear from the rest of the council. By that point, he had already accepted the amendment. Well, just Mr. City Attorney. I was under the impression that he did not accept the friendly amendment. But we can roll the tape. I don't think we need to roll the tape, but I think that I wasn't clear on whether it was accepted. I respect Councilwoman Price's position, but I think it was he wanted to hear it. I wanted to hear additional comments before I accepted their friendly stance. So that so the difference, as I understand the substitute substitute motion now incorporates the friendly it requests the further direction from the City Council, which was already in your original motion and changes it from 90 days to 60 days. And the subsequent change, in my view, is that 90 to 60 days of the motion. So that's correct. Okay. We're going to go through the motions. There is a substitute substitute motion that is essentially Councilmember Austin's main motion with the change from 90 to 60. Okay. Then we have a substitute substitute motion, which is the mongeau motion, which begins a process today or at this time, but then waits until 60 days after to come back to it, to come back to council for more direction. And then there's the main motion, which is the motion that we have before us, which is back to 90 days. All right. Those are the three motions on the floor. We're going to go ahead now. Go to two votes on these motions. Madam Clerk, are you. Are you correct? You ready? Okay, so on the substitute substitute motion, please cast your votes. This is the motion by Al Austin. Council member, Austin. Every motion carries for three. Okay. So the motion. The motion carries. Okay. All right. So now just just just to be clear. The City attorney. So I want to be sure everyone's issue like this is important that where everyone's on the same page. So do you want to repeat what past? Certainly, Mayor, members of the council, the substitute substitute motion passed 4 to 3 to withhold any action by the city manager until 90 days are until 60 days after full representation or until the 60 days after the fourth District Council person is seated, at which time the city manager will come back to the City Council for additional direction on the study for regarding a customs facility. Thank you. And what I want to just say, I know I haven't had a chance to say any comments. I want to make sure that a few things. One is, I want to thank everybody for coming out. I know this is an incredibly important issue to a lot of people, and it's important for us to hear all points of view on any issue before the council. And so I know it's contentious. I know it's emotional. I know that for a lot of you, you've been in this in this airport conversation for a very, very long time. That dates back before anybody was here, sat on this current council. So I understand that. And I also think it's important. I think staff understands that this is obviously clearly an incredibly important topic to a lot of folks, not just some of the council colleagues, but people in the community. And so as we move forward through this process, I think, Mr. West, the more that there's an opportunity to check in and provide, you know, public check ins about what the where the process is and where things are going, I think will serve everyone to ensure that people feel that there is a transparent process. And what I don't want what I don't want to happen is I don't want because listen, our staff works very hard and they have a lot of issues, not just this one that they're working on every single day. And they're also sometimes trying their best to get things done and bring information to the council and bring information to me as well. And what I want to make sure also is this is I think the more transparent we are in this process, I think it's not just better for the community, but it's Mr. West it's better for staff as well. I think everyone it's out it's out there and everyone gets a an even look into what's going on. So thanks again for coming down. We have a process and Madam Clerk, we're moving on. I'm sorry. Item. Yeah, we're. We're going to go to item 24 after a quick take a quick recess. So the one minute recess for a restroom. I'm going to roll the tape. Yeah. I want to know. How you do it. You know. Oh, my God. So I could. Like. I was going to ask her. She knows. Everything. But anyway. Here is your time. You're doing all right. Oh, we love. I got the answer. Okay, so we're just like, Hey, we let it go. I want to catch. So I would conclude. I need to find out. When they we're allowed to go. Back here and talk to Mr. Brady. All right. Issue. Should. I have no idea what we're like. Yeah. Yeah. So there. Because I know I be able to hear. I just didn't want. Well. A better way. Yeah. I feel like. Yeah. So are you. Do you? Really? Oh, yeah. I feel like I'm going to. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Be. Yeah. Where? People like you don't want. You got it right? No, not all. Well. It's not the. Okay. Why don't we go and back into session so I can have the council grab their seat? I would be like. Pretty. Okay. Madam Clerk. Would you like me to take a roll first? Vice Mayor Lowenthal Councilwoman Price. Councilwoman Mongo. Councilman Andrew's Council Member. You Ranga. Councilman Austin. Councilmember Richardson. Mayor Garcia. I'm here. Thank you. Next item, please.", "result": "Recommendation to direct City Manager to delay any action regarding requests for an international customs facility at the Long Beach Airport until receiving further direction from the City Council; and direct City Manager to delay any request for direction regarding a customs facility until 90 days after full representation on the City Council is completed."}
