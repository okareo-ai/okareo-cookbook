This issue was brought to my attention after litigation and a decision from the Court of Appeals for the state of Washington. In this case, the Seattle Housing Authority voucher recipient requested a change in her voucher from a studio apartment to a one bedroom apartment as a disability related accommodation. In this case, FHA was not the landlord. The FHA was only the voucher administrator. The court decided, based on a plain reading of the language in the Seattle Municipal Court, in the statutory context, supporting the legislative intent to cover only the landlord tenant relationship. It did not apply to FHA in its role as a voucher administrator. The court noted in its decision that if the city wishes to and extend the unfair practice requirement to include a requirement that Section eight program administrators like FHA making a reasonable accommodation when requested, it can amend the SC accordingly. This legislation is in direct response to the case and does so does amend the settlement code to allow the city to enforce the obligation for reasonable accommodation in instances where a provider is the the the housing and the housing voucher administrator, not the actual landlord.

With a restaurant has been operating at this location with entertainment since. 1991. The ownership changed in June 2017, which required the new owners to submit this application. The new owners have since been operating under a temporary entertainment permit. All of the necessary departments have reviewed the application and have provided their recommended conditions as contained in the hearing packet. I, as well as the police department, stand ready to answer any questions Council may have. And that concludes staff's report. Thank you. Is there any public comment on this item? I think this is a very good view, clear consideration. This is a commendable project. The only concern I have is relative to the dancing and what type of dancing there will be. Will we be saddled with the type of. Sidestepping or tap dancing around the truth, such as we get almost every time Robert Garcia opens his mouth. You can see what can be done to stop that type of dancing. That's something you have to consider before you approve it. And I think you have excellent examples of how proficient he is if dancing around the truth and sidestepping the facts and truth. Give that some consideration when you issue this permit. Thank you. Thank you. General public comment on this item. Mrs. Price was not clear if he thinks. Ask urge my colleagues to support this item. This hotel is located right next to the Gaslamp, where it currently is dancing. There's no dancing, sidestepping the truth, but there are sidesteps when they do their country Sunday line dancing. But this is this is just straight up dancing. Mr. Good here. Councilman. I thank you. And I'm happy to support this. I'm not sure how this has progressed, but I can remember several years ago entertained going to the Golden Cells Sunday nights for reggae and having a great time. So I wouldn't want to deprive anybody of that experience here in Long Beach. So I'm happy to support. Thank you very much. Cinnamon public comment. Would you please cast your vote, please? Now.

{"input": "Okay. Thank you. Now on to item 25. Report from Development Services Recommendation to Execute Mills Act Historic Property Contracts with owners of historic landmark properties for the preservation and rehabilitation of eight properties districts one, two, three and eight. Thank you. I'm Jenny Silver Staff. We have a report from Development Services Director Amy Barak and also Chris Coons. Mr. Mayor, and members of the City Council. First, I would like to formally introduce you to Christopher Coons, our advance planning officer. He also serves as our historic preservation officer. And the report that we're going to be giving tonight is largely the result of his efforts since he's been on staff. So I want to publicly acknowledge his involvement in moving the historic preservation program for this city forward. We are pleased to present to you tonight the First Mills Act contracts that have been adopted by the city since at least 2007. We are presenting to you a number of contracts that. Cover. Our residential and commercial buildings. This, as you know, was the first year that we. Instituted the Mills Act. And we went through a very extensive screening and education process with members of our historic community who may qualify for a Mills Act contract. This year, we were a little bit selective in only choosing to work with those properties who have already been landmarked within the city of Long Beach. And offered the Mills Act process to. Those existing homeowners or property owners. We hope to expand the program to a larger audience next year, and for those property owners who do have properties who are interested in Mills. Act but may not be historic landmark. Designated. We would do a combination process of we as we have detailed to you in the past. So I believe we have nine different contracts that we would ask you to consider entering into. This is a ten year contract with each of these individual property owners. There is a detailed contract that spells out what their requirements are. There is an obligation for the city to provide regular inspections to make sure that the contracts are being adhered to. There is a continued process that we will be involved in in the regular monitoring of these properties. I would say. Without hesitation that these nine properties. Represent the entire spectrum of the historic properties that are landmarked within the city. They do cover very unique single-family residential homes, and then they do cover some of our commercial buildings that are also landmarked. And you probably know most of these just by looking at their name and address, which which should point to their notoriety. If you've got specific. Questions about any of the applications, we are here to answer any questions. But that does conclude our initial staff report. Thank you. We have a motion in a second on this on this item.

Docket 0403 Message In order to reduce the fiscal year 22 appropriation for the reserve for collective bargaining by $2,954,828. To provide funding for various department departments for the fiscal year 22. Increases contained within the collective bargaining agreement between the city of Boston and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. AFL CIO Council 93 have Smith submits a report recommending that the order ought to pass. Thank you. The chair recognizes counsel, board chair of the Committee on City Services, Innovation Technology Council blocking of the floor. Thank you so much, President Flynn. We held a hearing on this docket, these two dockets on April 19th, 2022. And I want to thank President Flynn for joining me at that hearing. As was mentioned in the summary of the docket, this is for me. We've got 1040 employees who are covered by this bargaining unit. It's the second of the many unresolved contracts that are outstanding that have come before the council in this session for council ratification of their funding. It follows the same pattern as the one that we that we approved a couple of weeks ago. So that's, as was mentioned, the 2% raise effective October 2020, the 1.5% October 2021, and then the 2% for October 2022. It also includes a $1,000 lump sum payment for each member related to the fact that the Acme employees across a number of different departments in the city, most of them were really in pretty frontline roles during the pandemic. And so that was an item that came up at the bargaining table. Unlike the Senate contract, it also adds Juneteenth as a recognized holiday within the contract and also adds a couple of wellness days in July in relationship to the vaccine. Moa. The you know, one of the things that we discussed in the committee was just, you know, Councilor Flynn raised the question of why is that? Why is that middle year 1.5 instead of 2%? I mean, partly has to do with the fact that this is the. The contracts that are being settled this year, they kind of have to work with the bargaining reserve that we had for the last year because we're back funding things right from prior fiscal years. And so there's a little bit of a limitation of scope of what was in the bargaining reserve for FY 21 and 22. But again, I think the lump sum payment was part of that conversation. We one of the things we raised was that the council, in sort of the last round of big contract resolutions some time ago now in 2015, expressed the fact that, you know, when we're setting a pattern, we want to make sure that our civilian workers in the city are are seeing their pay increase in ways that are comparable to foreign workers, because that's that's kind of gone out of whack in the last 20 years. So these are civilian this is asking is the biggest civilian union that besides the teachers union that's still outstanding. Um, and, uh, yeah, it was, it was a good, good hearing. I will just say that I know because I heard from them that we have a large number of absentee members who are eager for this to be passed because the way this works for folks who are new is that folks don't get their retroactive pay increase until this is approved and funded by the council. Um, so I know that there are people waiting on those checks and you know, I think it's consistent, like I said, with the pattern that's come before us already and that seems, um, within the fiscal capacity of the city. We had both Jim Williamson, the budget director, and Lou Mediterranee, the special advisor for the mayor, come and join us on the 19th. So. Mr. Chair, my recommendation, um, for these two dockets, again, just operationally, one is for us to actually take the money and draw down the bargaining reserve, which we approved at the last budget cycle . And then the other is to actually appropriate it across these various departments to fund the contract. And so my recommendation, Mr. Chair, is that both docket 0402 and 0403 pass. Thank you. Thank you, Councilor Barker. The Council blocked the chair on the Committee of City Services. Innovation Technology seeks acceptance of the Committee report and passage of Docket 0402.

{"input": "Item 12 item calls a recommendation to adopt plans and specifications for the Naples Island permanent seawall repairs. So moved a motion and a second. Any public comment on the item? Mr. Goodhue. An up. Very good. You click as the address. I support the concept in chief and I've studied the plan for doing it and moving forward in this first phase. And I think it makes it eminent sense. And I think also the mitigation plan for this first section makes sense. I'm not sure about the mitigation for the balance of the program, but at least for this sense that makes and for this first phase, it makes sense where the problem comes up. Excuse me. 1/2 and. Where the problem. Surfaces is in the the funding of it. And I support using tidelands funds. But I think the city is going to find itself in a position of not being able to use those tidelands funds pending the given the specter of the pending indictment and arrest the Vice mayor. Commissioner. Coastal Commissioner Garcia. There are some details handed out here relative to that, and next week I'll go further into it. But I think the city needs to examine methods of financing at it other than the Tidelands Agency, because I think the requisite authorities that have the ability to do so are going to put the foot on the neck until they clean up the corruption that is set forth in not only here, but this comes on the heels, of course, as you know, the chief counsel for the Department of Boating Waterways caught the city trying to illegally use money to benefit friends of Bob Foster in the Long Beach Yacht Club. That does not instill confidence. So I think it's foolish to move forward counting on the Tidelands funds until they get a master in here to clean up the shop. I think they've come to realize now that the potential dollars that we're talking about here are approaches, approaches that which has resulted in the increase in the incarceration of the people in Bell. The instant issue here that brings it into focus is to S and the Marine stadium that was put forward that saying it was an epicenter of crime. The police reports clearly that are in your hands now showing that there's no crime. The building is secured at night with iron curtains, \u00a3200 each. All of both of which are chained with chain and steel at night. There is no crime. It was a ruse to make a gift to $300,000 to a few select people. That is going to hold up, I believe, the use of tidelands funds. Thank you. Vice Chair Councilors if I can, to point out as a city manager, we have no idea what. Mr. Good he is talking about. Any of the allegations just made are just made up. We have no idea. We never heard about this. So I just want to make that very, very clear that we have no idea what he's talking about. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Break the chains. Good evening, Council and vice mayor. I appreciate you letting me speak today. Maureen Poe from 144 7:00 Naples. Since 1939, the present Naples sea walls have been standing and they've stood the test of time. But more than 18 years ago, the city had prudently paid attention to the cries from homeowners in the Naples Improvement Association, and they had done several studies. One of them was the Cash and Associates, and one of them was the Moffatt and Nickel Report. And when I was president of the Nhia, they came to a meeting and they told people that we have walls that are deteriorating and we have to do something about them quickly. And they had an estimate that it would cost about 78 million to do the entire island. And with neighborhood volunteers, we came together and formed a seawall committee and about 20 people have consistently, once a month for 18 years every month, come together to provide input and to work with the city. And public works has been very receptive and responsive to our requests. And talking about these public seawalls, the city council is always provided us with continual funding during that time period to work on road repair. And there was a study done by the State Lands Commission and the city. There was a study prepared by transit systems and that particular one, the gentleman who was doing it, could even pull the wall pieces out by hand. So it was at that point it was in imminent danger of failure. And so six phases of a project were established at that time and moved ahead. Tetra Tech developed the phases in pieces and then the Coastal Commission looked at it. And through the help of Councilman DeLong and through continued help of our vice mayor here, he worked on the committee on the commission, the Coastal Commission, and helped to formulate the ways that we could get a project through that would be on the water side, because we were looking at the birds that nested the created creatures in the water. We looked at the public access and make sure that public access was being addressed. And so the plan that has been finally come up and it's taken more than eight years to pull it together, is now before you. And we know that we don't want to spend any more money on studies, and we know that this is a good use of the Thailande fund for public access to our waterways and the Coastal Commission blessed it. And we'd like you to bless it tonight. Thank you. Thank you, Maureen, for all your work and the other public comments. Sea none believe there's a motion on the floor for item 12.

Environmental impacts and health and safety have not been properly researched or analyzed. I am asking you to postpone lifting the overlay due to legality issues pertaining to health and safety that has not been followed regarding the GSA property. The environmental report shows that there is at least 20% of asbestos, lead paint and other chemicals in the building and soil. Why would we expose persons with compromised immune systems and complex medical problems to point to a poisoning building?

The municipal code requires that the G overlay be removed when a lease has been legally obtained with the federal government. We have legally obtained a lease with the federal government and I want to thank the four of you that that understood the legal requirements of the city. And and more importantly than that, the moral obligations of doing this project and have supported this going forward. I ask again tonight that you remove the you overlay. More importantly than that, do I want you to know I want the community to know. I want the Friends of Crab Cove to know very clearly. We are committed to developing a safe port project that fits in with their community and we've asked to enter into a community agreement with them that will hold us accountable for making sure it's safe. And we're committed to doing that. We're committed to continuing the dialog forward on that and make sure that everybody understands the type of project we're doing is not the type of project that will damage the housing, that will damage the community. It's for fragile seniors, homeless, who need medical care. It's the homeless that you won't see in the cancer treatment center. You've gone to mayor because they're not allowed to go there because they're homeless. We'll be providing them shelter so that they can get cancer treatment. That to Alameda cares about. That's who's being served by this project. Removing the T overlay will be the next step in helping us move forward on it. Thank you very much. Motion to go ahead. Member Ashcraft I would like to move final passage of the ordinance amending Alameda Zoning map for the property on the west side of McKay Avenue to remove the G government, combining district designation to allow for private use of the property for a wellness center. Second. So I won't be supporting the motion. However, I do want to comment in regards to the last speaker. Some of the places where I have gotten my cancer treatments, homeless people of all socioeconomics attend and go there. So I want to clarify that. However, I also had raised concerns before.

{"input": "Next, we have a proclamation that I'll ask council and can use to read proclamation number 583. Thank you, Madam President. It's my honor to read Proclamation 583 series of 14 Acknowledging the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 and the American Indian Arts and Crafts Symposium in Denver. Whereas, in 1990, the Indian Arts and Crafts Act was passed to prohibit misrepresentation and mark in the marketing of Indian art and craft work in the United States. And. Whereas, the Act makes it illegal to offer or display for sale or sell any art of craft product in a manner that falsely states it is Indian produced an Indian product or the product of a specific Indian tribe which can result in a fine of up to $250,000 and or imprisonment up to five years for an individual. If the total sales transaction is valued at $1,000 or more, or a fine up to $1 million for a first time violation by a business. Whereas the Indian Arts and Crafts Act defines that an Indian and or Indian tribe is a member of a federal or official state recognized tribe, and that a certified Indian artisan is certified as a nonmember Indian artisan by the governing body of an Indian tribe from which the individual is a direct, lineal descendant. And. Whereas, on Thursday, July 17th, 2014, the Denver American Indian Commission will host the U.S. Department of the Interior for a one day American Indian Arts and Crafts symposium at the McNichols Building, starting at 9 a.m.. That will bring various key organizations together to discuss local and statewide museums and historic sites across Colorado to encourage them to buy and sell authentic American Indian and Alaska Native art within their respective shops. And. WHEREAS, in addition, the symposium will expand markets for authentic American Indian goods. And therefore increase economic prosperity for American Indian artists and give them the opportunity to showcase their work. And. WHEREAS, The Denver American Indian Commission is one of the co-sponsors of this symposium and an active partner in addressing these issues, the Commission encourages people to contact the Indian Arts and Crafts Board at w dot i acb that dui dot gov. If you become aware of any market activity in violation of the act. Now, therefore, be it proclaimed by the City of the Council of the City and County of Denver, Section one that the Denver City Council acknowledges the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 and encourages residents of Denver to attend this symposium to learn more about Indian art and craft work in Section two that the Clerk of the city and County of Denver shall attest in a fix the seal of the city and county of Denver to this proclamation and that copies be transmitted to the Denver American Indian Commission, the Rocky Mountain Indian Chamber of Commerce, and the Department of the Interior, Indian Arts and Crafts Board. Thank you. Councilman Kenny's your motion to adopt. Thank you. Madam President, I move that, perhaps proclamation 583 be adopted. Okay. It's been moved and seconded. Comments by Council Councilwoman Kennish. Thank you, Madam President. I love this job. Serving as a member of City Council on a daily basis, I learn new things. And in the course of serving on the Health and Safety Committee, we receive updates from our commissions. And this is one of the updates they provided about this symposium. I have been, like many of you have been at museums or gift shops where you see beautiful jewelry, maybe earrings or trinkets, maybe some turquoise that you believe might be American Indian art. And maybe you turn it over and you look at it and it says, Made in China on the bottom. And you have this kind of feeling like something isn't right there. And in the case of this proclamation, I thought it was important for us all to understand not only is that not right, it's not legal. And I think it's really great that our commission is getting together with the federal government to really not just identify what the law is in regards to really making sure that the things that you sell are authentic, but also saying, if I am a museum, if I am a gift shop, how is it that I could find authentic art? Who do I call? Where do I find an artisan who makes great earrings, makes great jewelry, makes great paintings? And this is the opportunity, this symposium on Thursday. So I shared this proclamation because I was pleased to know that after the many wrongs that the U.S. government has perpetrated over time with regard to native peoples , that we are also working to use the law to help protect those artisans who, you know, are trying to make a living as artists, but competing against goods that might be made overseas or elsewhere and certainly made at lower cost than a handmade artisan would be doing from a native tribe. So I encourage all of us to be smarter shoppers and to help when we are in places where Native American art could be sold to help educate our shopkeepers and others about this act as we move forward and to maybe think about checking out this symposium on Thursday the 17th. Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilwoman Robb. Thank you, Madam President. And thank you, Councilwoman Kennish, for bringing this forward, because I to learn something new every day. And this was. One of the things I learned. I'm very supportive of this. When I was a young adult, my father had retired and was a marketing consultant to the Navajo Nation, and that was a very interesting experience for our whole family. What I think is great is that this is a this is a great event for the McNichols building. This really shows what our cultural. Buildings can do, too. So it brings the strength of the city to a very interesting topic. So thank you for bringing it forward. Thank you, Councilwoman Robb. And Madam Secretary, it looks like we're ready for a roll call.

The proclamation is adopted. Councilwoman, is there someone you'd like to invite to the podium? Yes. Jennifer Williams, who's a member of our American Indian Commission. Good evening. I just want to really say thank you to all. Council members for voting on this. Proclamation. Tonight. I think the event on the 17th is really going. To help build. Awareness. And really the bottom line is to build. Economic. Development among native artists locally, you know, and within the whole state of Colorado. This kind of came about. Because the commission did. Some art. Shows up at Red. Rocks. And while we were sitting outside and it was really beautiful to have 25 vendors. Selling their art. I noticed inside at the gift shop, you know, native stuff, supposedly native items that were. Really made from China excuse me, really made from China and different places. And so after about a year of a couple of years, we've been planning this event. So I just think that it's really important, especially for our artists, to be able to build their build their art and not to have it taken for granted. So I hope you guys can all come out. We also are going to do a walking tour in the afternoon to the Colorado History Museum and the Buyers Evans House and the Denver Art Museum. So hopefully you can stop by. And. Then we're going to have a reception at the Native American Trading Company right on 13th. Bannock after that. So hopefully you can come by and check it out. Thank you. Thank you very much, Ms.. Williams. Okay. We are ready for the resolutions.

{"input": "I'm honored to. Madam President, this is proclamation number 21, dash 0050 honoring Nick Mitchell for his services, Denver's Independent Monitor. Whereas Nicholas E Nick Mitchell was born in New Jersey in 1975, moving with his mother and brother to Brooklyn, New York, in 1986 and following his primary and secondary schooling in Brooklyn, Nick studied political science at Evergreen State College in Washington State, after which he returned home to take a job at the New York Civilian Complaint Review Board in 1999. And. Whereas, in his job at the review board, Nick investigated complaints against NYPD officers and presented his officers findings in court. But his desire to be on the other side of the witness stand led him to enroll at the Fordham University School of Law in 2004. And. Whereas, during the summer of his first year of law school, Nick got a grant to work in the domestic court system in Sierra Leone and on a genocide case at the U.N. Special Court for Sierra Leone Finishing Law School, he took a job at a large international law firm, Allen and Overy in New York City, but never felt at ease defending CEOs from Department of Justice investigations. And. Whereas, in 2008, Nick joined attorneys around the U.S. who successfully sued then-President George W Bush to ensure that habeas corpus extended to defendants at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba, visiting Gitmo to interview detainees about whether they had legally moved through the judicial system. And. Whereas, Nick's love of the great outdoors led him on a weekend trip to Colorado in 2011, following which he decided to make the move from Brooklyn to Denver and shortly thereafter took a job litigating at a local law firm. And. Whereas, not long thereafter, Nick applied for and was ultimately appointed by Mayor Michael B Hancock as Denver's second independent monitor in August 2012. And. WHEREAS, during his time as Monitor, Nick's office oversaw thousands of investigations into complaints of misconduct misconduct clearing many Denver Police Department officers and Denver Sheriff Department deputies while ensuring accountability for those who abused their authority in the public trust. And. WHEREAS, Nick issued multiple reports about problematic practices in the Denver Sheriff Department, including the mishandling of inmate grievances and the tragic death of Michael Marshall at the hands of deputy sheriff personnel, triggering major reforms in Denver's jails. And. WHEREAS, at the unanimous request of Denver City Council, Nick conducted a sweeping investigation into the Denver Police Department response to protests in downtown Denver following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, making 16 recommendations for reform, all of which were adopted by Denver Police Department. And. Whereas, as Monitor, Nick served as co-chair of the Denver Sheriff Department Use of Force Policy Committee, which transformed use of force standards for Denver deputies. Nick also issued public guidance about deficiencies in the DPP use of force policy leading to the complete rewrite of the policy, and released an analysis of body worn camera use by DPD officers resulting in significant enhancements on their use. And. WHEREAS, he co-founded the Bridging the Gap Kids and Cops program, which is one national recognition for helping to transform relationships between police officers and youth in Denver. And. Whereas, Nick led three successful efforts to change the law that empowers the oh. I am including a city charter amendment passed in 2016 with the support of 72% of Denver voters. And. WHEREAS, Mitchell received awards from the Denver Bar Association and the National Association for Civilian Oversight of Law Enforcement has been recognized as an expert on civilian oversight and law enforcement reform by CNN. The new. Yorker and other national publications and consulted with numerous cities seeking to enhance oversight of law enforcement, including Phenix, Tulsa, Madison, Baltimore, Colorado Springs, Aurora and others. And. Whereas, Nick was selected to be a Gates fellow in the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, senior executives in state and local government program in 2013, elected as a director of the National Association for Civilian Oversight of Law Enforcement in 2014 and appointed to the Board of Governors of the Colorado Bar Association in 2018. And. WHEREAS, on January four, 2021, Nick Mitchell left his role as Denver's Independent Monitor to oversee a Department of Justice consent decree with the County of Los Angeles and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. The consent decree is a court ordered agreement designed to correct systemic, unconstitutional conditions in the Los Angeles County jails, the largest municipal jail system in the world. Now, therefore, let it be proclaimed by the Council of the City and County of Denver. Section one, the City Council of the City and County of Denver. Thanks, Mitchell, for his dedicated service as independent monitor, exemplified by his efforts to increase safety for all the residents of Denver, while increasing the transparency of oversight of Denver's safety agencies and transforming, transforming Denver's Office of the Independent Monitor into a model emulated across the country Section two that the clerk of the city and county of Denver shall fix the seal of the city and county of Denver to this proclamation and that a copy be transmitted to Nick Mitchell. Thank you, Councilman Cashman. Your motion to adopt. Yes, Madam President. I move the proclamation 20 1-0050 be adopted. Okay. Thank you. It has been moved and we've got the movement. And then second by Councilwoman Ortega comments by members of council. Councilman Cashman. Have we checked to see if Councilman Herndon wanted to cut in on that? Okay. I think we're good. All right. Thank you, Madam President. You know, the office of the Independent Monitor, the VOA I am, may actually be the best friend our safety agencies have in this time when the people and policies of policing are called into question on a regular basis. VOA I am serious to not only ensure accountability and transparency where missteps occur, but to show just as clearly when the facts reveal that those policies and those people have performed as needed. And as expected, Nick Mitchell has not just done his job during his time as Denver's independent monitor, but through his unquestionable integrity, has dogged commitment to searching out the truth wherever it may lie in his clear presentation of the truth he has uncovered. He has strengthened the position for those who will follow. His predecessor will step into a far different context than did monitor Mitchell when he was appointed. While the Monitor and his talented staff and his dedicated cohort received much attention and deserve kudos for high profile reports such as the Marshall Report and the recent report issued after George Floyd's murder led to protests across the country many hundreds, perhaps thousands of less publicized but equally as important investigations received the same detailed attention that monitor Mitchell and his team devoted to the tragic events I mentioned earlier. I enjoyed working with Nick Mitchell. He worked hard. He maintained good humor most of the way. And his personal agenda, whatever it might have been, was set aside so as to not sully the search for the truth. I mean, I'm guessing there are other folks out there who can serve Denver with the same skills and the same backbone that Nick Mitchell brought to the job. But I'm also sure they are few and far between and the search committee has a rough job ahead to fill some big shoes in a big city in today's America . I can think of no job more important than an independent monitor. And in closing, Madam President, I just want to thank Nick Mitchell for all he has done for for Denver.

Vice Mayor Richardson. I want to reserve my comments after the staff report, please. Mr. West. Mike Conway Mayor Garcia, Member City Council. This item relates to a future development. Property located at the northeast corner of Atlantic Avenue and Artesia. Boulevard. This property contains 2.14 acres and is undeveloped. An RFP was released and four submittals were received. The selection panel unanimously preferred the proposal submitted by frontier real estate investments. While the price offered for the property was slightly. Lower than the highest price, the total investment value. Was significantly higher. The developer proposals proposes to develop 13,200 square feet of commercial and retail buildings with proposed uses that are needed. Within the local community, including. A commercial bank. Staff request the council approve. The recommended action, and I stand ready to answer your questions. Thank you. I'll go ahead and give my comments now, Mr. Mayor. Okay. So I'm obviously thrilled to be approving this project tonight. Having worked, you know, as chief of staff to Councilman Neal, who's here in the audience and working in this community for four, six, seven years. This is the one project that, you know, people for decades have asked about when are we going to develop this vacant lot on Atlantic in Artesia? So so tonight, this is the second of three major ninth District successor, Regency Park properties that's moving forward and really anchors the corner of Atlantic as well as Artesia, the developer Frontier Real Estate Investments has extensive experience and experience in development construction. I was very impressed with the proposal that they submitted. They demonstrated a strong focus on community needs, and it was very responsive to community interests. They've committed to civic engagement, continuing civic engagement through the course of this process, setting a new design standard for for our community and helping us to achieve our goals that, you know, we've we've we've looked for for a long time a number of amenities that have been lacking in District nine and North Long Beach, namely a financial institution targeting a sit down restaurant and retail space spaces for the community to gather. And I want to borrow former Vice Mayor Lowenthal comment, the public living room, a coffee shop and a development that really anchors much of the other activities taking place on the Artesian Atlantic corridor. So this is this is pretty huge for for us here in North Long Beach. We're really excited about this. I'm confident that the developer will fulfill the vision of the site and look forward to the full development along the timeline. So thank you. And those are my comments. Councilman Ranga. I totally support this motion and I congratulate Richardson on a successful project. And I also want to congratulate Vice Mayor Richardson, but also staff. You guys worked very hard on this. Very, very hard. And I love all the development that's happening in Long Beach right now. I love it. I love this. I want to fill all these frickin open parcels with development. The more, the better. Come on down. Develop our city, the more. It's missing a couple flagpoles. But besides that. Any public comment? Please come forward. Yes. Josh Butler with Housing Long Beach. We two commend the city for being able to sell all these vacant lots and develop them as well. We just want to be sure and I know a speaker came to council recently to ask if we're following the Surplus Land Act, which requires that these properties be offered up for affordable housing development as well as perhaps parks space as well. This has been a major issue in other cities and including Oakland, which had to turn back around on the sale of many of their properties to provide opportunities for public space, affordable housing and given the amount of public land that we've been selling off on a regular basis here all throughout the downtown, and now we're seeing already a lot sell sold off in other cities. I just want to make sure that we don't come back and have to look at that. We did not follow the Surplus Land Act and if any council members have had any conversations about that at all. Thank you. We just want to go on record as at least questioning this and the sale of other properties as well. Well, Miami property, the Long Beach Boulevard property that was recently sold as well. Questions about whether or not affordable housing developers had an opportunity at purchasing that property. Thank you. We have addressed that question. Mr. City Attorney, do you want to comment on that? Yes, we have complied with the Surplus Land Act and that notice was sent. I think you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Good evening, Mayor. City Council and Staff. My name is Tasha Hunter with the Uptown Business Improvement District. And I want to say that we're very excited to have this development frontier come. The community has we've had some focus groups since I've been in the position as the business district manager and one of the common denominators and common things said was that the community wanted something to do, they wanted a place to go, and they wanted they wanted a nice sit down restaurant bank and as vice mayor said, coffee shop, different things. So we're very excited. The business district supports having Frontier there and we look forward to breaking ground. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker. Good evening, esteemed Mayor. City Council. My name is Steve Neal. Address on file. And I would like to thank the city council and Councilmember Richards, Vice Mayor Richardson, for his diligence in this project. I can speak on behalf of the communities of North Long Beach and they are very excited about this development. This parcel has been sitting vacant prior to my term, going back into the term of my predecessor. So it is well overdue. So I'd like to commend you on your hard work and thank you for your diligence. Congratulations. Steve, I just want to tell you, we desperately miss you. I just getting your. Let me say something. After after sitting here tonight. I loved it while I was here. But you guys are doing a bang up job and continue to fight. I just get it. And congratulations, Councilmember, on the major appointment. Next speaker, please. Hi. Good evening. My name is Susan Doan and I'm a property owner in Long Beach. I'm also a broker and I really want to say thank you for letting me speak tonight. And Councilman Richardson, congratulation on your magnificent project. These RDA properties have been sitting vacant and unused long enough since the I guess the idea went away in 2011. I have one question. There is over a 500,000 shortage of housing in the state of California. L.A. County alone has 50,000. These are facts that you can substantiate. I also have a client in Long Beach who is an affordable housing developer, and he indicated to me on numerous occasions that Long Beach was unfriendly to to them as far as their developing. So they went out of the area and even out of state. My question is, can we use some of these RDA properties for affordable housing? That's it. Thank you. Thank you. And I do know that just just to clarify. So the way that these properties work, I believe we've actually had about over 200 parcels across the city that we're selling. And part of the process is that the city is also limited on what actually can be develop on the site. And so there's actually a state stamped, approved, approved process of what and how we have to sell these properties. And in many cases, in some cases, it's to the highest bidder. In other cases, it's a pre-development agreement with the city. In other cases, it's just a fire sale on the property. And so I just want to also clarify that with the city part of this process, the city lot has lost a lot of control in how to develop these parcels as well. But we have a motion in a second. And again, congratulations on this is fantastic. Please cast your vote. Motion carries. Thank you. Next item, please. Item 16. Let's go back to 17. I'm sorry, did we do it? I don't think we did. 17.

{"input": "And item 27 Council Bill 120058 relating to the Office of Housing, authorizing the acceptance of a transfer of real property in southeast Seattle. The committee recommends the bill pass. Thank you so much. Customers, get back to you to provide us this committee report. Thank you very much. Council president, colleagues. Again, this is the item that came from the Housing and Finance Committee that came to us from the Office of Housing to accept the land transfer from sound transit to Office of Housing for the purpose of developing for purchase affordable homes. There are three main points that I'd like to really highlight as you consider this legislation today. The first is that the city is accepting this land at no cost. This is possible through our commitment to the land disposition policies that we have seen really featured in Sound Transit First and then what I replicated as well in our land disposition policies passed in 2018. This is our city's commitment to making sure that if we have surplus or underused land, especially when starting with sound transit, that we make sure that this property is available for the highest and best public use. And right now that's housing. The second thing to consider is that this land is located in the South End near three light rail stations Mount Baker, Columbia City and Othello Station, and is a response to the community's ongoing demand for more affordable housing located in these existing communities that have seen a tremendous amount of displacement and a skyrocketing cost of housing over the years. Again, with the need to make sure that we address housing is not just building more affordable units, but it's also creating opportunities for people to have home ownership opportunities, which this ordinance allows. And the final thing is that this focus, as I just mentioned, is on creating a for purchase housing. This land provides accessible home ownership opportunities for Seattle residents, creating a path out of generational poverty and allowing folks to create greater equity in their pocket. This is also a commitment to our equity principles for more people to be able to have a place to call home that they can own, which allows for folks to build build wealth in their own community. The last point, I think, is extremely important as we recognize a disproportionate amount of wealth in whiter households in Seattle compared to black and brown households, which can be traced directly back to our exclusionary policies of redlining that prevent many bipoc communities from being able to purchase their homes in the city of Seattle. And this is not only part of our past, but it's still the living policy of our city. So we're really trying to provide more opportunities now for folks to be able to continue to afford to live in the city. According to a report released by Prosperity Now, the pre-COVID median wealth for white residents in Seattle was three times higher than that of Native American households. Black residents were three times more likely to be unemployed than white residents. And this all compounds to fewer opportunities to allow for folks to be able to own homes in this city. This project, this opportunity is one way that the city can begin to address the past and begin to help close the wage gap. As we look for many opportunities for future affordable housing options and home ownership options to ensure that more bipoc communities can continue to live and thrive in our Seattle for general, in Seattle for generations to come. We'll continue to do more work to close this gap, and I look forward to more funding opportunities in housing and an equitable development, and especially using our Jumpstart Seattle dollars, about two thirds of those dollars going into housing and home opportunities, especially making sure that those who don't have opportunities have a place to call home and appropriate shelter. And this is an indication of our ongoing commitment to the need for creating more affordable and accessible housing and addressing the disparities that we see in our city. So looking forward to this legislation being passed today. Thank you very much. Thank you so much. Councilmember Mesquita, any other comments on the bill? Councilmember Morales, please. Thank you. I just want to share that. I am very excited about this legislation. This is an opportunity to create more permanently affordable home ownership, not just rental units, but home ownership opportunities, particularly in the South End. And that means that these homes will be affordable not just for the first home buyer, but for the subsequent homebuyers to the original homebuyer will get a reasonable rate of return when they sell. But the price is still allowing the next owner to also participate and enjoy the benefits of home ownership. So I think this is a really important opportunity. I do want to also note that there's been an a really important community engagement process for years to make sure that this happens. I want to thank Puget Sound Sage for advocating and helping pass the legislation that required South Transit to offer 80% of their surplus property to organizations that are doing affordable housing to low income folks . And this is really a chance for those of us in the South End to move past the numerous fenced off lots that have lined the light rail stations for the last ten years. I'm really excited to see that, you know, the the fenced off lots along the way are starting to be to be used and that this in particular will be used for for homeownership opportunities. So I just want to say thank you again for sponsoring this, leading this Councilmember Mosqueda. And I do want to also thank director Alvarado and Ericka malone for working so hard on this. I'm really looking forward to more. Homeownership opportunities. In the South End. Thank you. Thank you so much. Councilman Morales couldn't agree with you more. It's important for us to do sort of the both. And obviously, we all want to continue to support affordable pathways to do those units in our community that are only subject to rent. We know that over 50% of the people in the city rent. And I think the last time I looked, about 30% of those renters are bipoc folks. So but obviously the most important, critical thing that we can do to ensure that we are that we are actually making a meaningful difference in terms of closing the wealth gap in income inequality is to allow people opportunities to have affordable homeownership. So really excited about this bill. Sorry that I wasn't in committee to vote it out of committee, but I am really excited about being able to support this particular council bill and thanks to everyone for playing a really important role in getting in front of us . Councilmember Mosquito, would you like to have a last word? Thank you very much. Just echoing the appreciation for folks who have for a long time focused on sound transit and the city of Seattle land disposition policies. The 80, 80, 80 principle is something that we replicated in the land disposition policies that the city passed and with the things that folks like Puget Sound, Sage, Africa Town and so many others who were at the table wanting to make sure that that type of principle expanded to other local jurisdictions. This is one of many efforts that we hope to highlight in the future. I want to thank after Houston for his work also on this legislation. In addition to Director Alvarado, as Councilman Morales accurately pointed out, he's really been spearheading this within the Office of Housing and to her team for their continued commitment to making sure that there's more opportunities like this. Obviously, much more work to come. And we'll continue to follow up to make sure that it's not just affordable housing opportunities that we're creating for renters and first time buyers, but that we're creating that pipeline so that people have that next place to buy. So there really is a place to move into as people acquire additional equity and the next generation or the next folks get a chance to move into these homes as well. It requires us to continue building, building, building. So thanks so much for your continued support on this for the comments today. Wonderful. Thank you so much. I don't see any other comments or folks with their hands up. So will the clerk please call the role on the passage of the bill? ROSQUETA. Hi. Peterson. I want. Yes. Strauss. Yes. Lewis. Yes.

{"input": "Thank you very much. We have one individual signed up to speak this evening, Jessie Pearce. Good evening. Members of council, members of the audience, those watching at home. My name is Jesse Pearce. I'm running for I was running for city council at large. Almost 15,000 votes with no money. I'll be running again to be your next mayor in 2023. And the slogan still stands Justice for the Poor People, Our Profit. And I reside in Candy's district, county seat of Bacchus District. And I represent several organizations such as Denver Homeless Outlaw, Black Star Action War, Self-defense, Positive Action Committee for Social Change, as well as Unity Party of Colorado, Denver, and as well as Universal African People's Organization . And you can find me on Mile-High News, YouTube and Facebook minus someone regards to this. I'm in approval of it. Cashman is an awesome council person. The council hall is awesome as well, but I have nothing to say about this. Good, good job, Cashman. This should easily get passed, so I have no qualms about that. And thank you for allowing me to speak this evening. Thank you. That concludes our speakers. Are there any questions? Oh, to Shannon Stage also signed up. Sorry, I missed that one. Since we do. Have the owners too, I think there might be a problem with when. We get for. To speak. Okay, so we're getting that ironed out. Looks like they're starting to pop up now on my screen. So Shannon stage, if you want to go next and then I also have Kristi minnillo. So if someone else other than those two signed up, then please talk to our council secretary. Excuse me, councilman and Lori Tetlock, who is the owner of the home, is also there trying to get that straightened out. To. All right. Got it. So now I have all three of you. Three. Okay, go ahead. Okay. Good evening, council members. Sorry about that. Technical difficulties. My name is Shannon Stage and I am the preservation coordinator at Historic Denver. As many of you know, historic Denver is a preservation nonprofit here in our city that is a community resource to owners like the tap blocks that are here tonight. We are a preservation nonprofit that advocates for Denver's unique character and historic buildings. The landmarking process is a major undertaking by homeowners. There's a lot of research involved, as well as the application and of course, the city process itself. So we want to thank the Tat LAX for wanting to designate their home and bringing it to you tonight. This significant commitment. This is a significant commitment. A historic Denver was happy to help John and Lori Tat walk through this process. They first reached out to us over a year ago and so I connected them up with the consultant. They ended up using Kristi minnillo who researched and wrote the designation application. It is exciting to see the Pete Catwalk House hopefully becoming a Denver landmark tonight, and we hope other building owners will be inspired by their commitment to preserving a small part of Denver's story. The Catwalk House clearly meets the designation criteria, as Jenny mentioned in her presentation, being influential in the development of Washington Park and this Italian Renaissance revival house is an excellent example of JJ Benedict's architectural legacy. So we urge you tonight to honor the Tat Locke's hard work and yet to get this designation before you and urge you to designate this worthy House as a Denver landmark. Thank you very much. Thank you. Next up, many Mineo. Good evening, city council members. My name is Chrissy Minnillo and as Shannon mentioned, I prepared the landmark application for the Lock House that's built between 1916 and 1917 and located in Washington Park. The property is directly associated with the early development of the area. It was designed by one of Denver's most well-known architects, J.J. Benedict, who also designed the boathouse at the south end of Smith Lake in Wash Park, as well as another house that follows on tonight's agenda. The permit for the property was filed in September 16, September 1916 by a woman named Jane Pee Pee, who was a widow , came to Denver from the East Coast with her two young boys in 1914 and was immediately involved in real estate speculation and development. She had an appreciation for the arts, specifically French literature and poetry, and she was involved in the historic art club. So it's really no surprise that she would commission Benedict to design this house, and the two must have had a decent relationship because she'd worked with him a couple of times, a couple of years before. On the design of the cabin house, which is located two properties to the south. She and her two boys lived in this home, the Pete home, until 1922 or 1923 when she moved back to the East Coast. This house is an excellent and intact example of the Italian Renaissance revival style, which was popular in this country between 1890 and 1930. What makes this property significant from an architectural standpoint is that it appears to be the most imaginative of Benedict's known designs in this style. Yet it remains approachable and fitting of its urban neighborhood environment. It must be noted that Laurie Tetlock and her family have been caring for the property for the past 55 years and have made relatively few changes as they respect its unique characteristics and history. The property has experienced these few alterations and because of that retains integrity of location, design, setting materials, workmanship and association. I support the designation of this beautiful property as a Denver landmark. Thank you. Thank you. And next up, Laurie Tack. Yes. So I'm Laurie. Tetlock. And I live at 1168 South Gilpin. My family moved there in 1964. And I went to Washington Park Elementary School, Byers and South High School. There have been a number of changes in Washington Park, and we just seem to be losing the character all the time. And because of the unique nature of this property, it's on four city lots and people are coming in and paying incredible amounts. Of money for a vacant lot. And they would tear it down. And so that was our greatest fear. We I was married in the yard. My girls have been married in the yard. And we just are pretty excited about having an a historic property. Thank you very much. All right. That now concludes our speakers. Are there any questions for members of council on this item? All right. Seeing none of the public hearing for Council 1119 is closed. Comments by members of Council. Councilman Cashman. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to thank the chat logs for and I said this when they brought it to committee for the gift of preserving this home, as you so ably pointed out. A house on four lots in that neighborhood, as lovely as that house is, would probably be gone. And the dollars seem to be making more of those decisions. You know, I had someone teasing me before the meeting. Where was every house in District six going to end up being designated? Because we we do have an active preservation community in the watch park area. Christina Park, the University of Denver area. And we've been fortunate to have a number of great designations come before this body, but all of them added together. Even with the 176 homes in the Christina Park overlay district only begin to approach an identifiable fraction of a percent. Most of the homes in all of our neighborhoods are going to go the way of history at one point or another. And so, again, thank you for allowing us the privilege to have yours around. A couple of quotes that I found that I thought, speak to this. The idea of preservation, especially poignantly, John Sawhill says, in the end, our society will be defined not only by what we create, but by what we refuse to destroy. I like that. And then a quote for which I was unable to find attribution. What a country chooses to save is what a country chooses to say about itself. So, you know, I appreciate that we have the opportunity to have this piece of our history to learn from and to carry us forward. So I look forward to supporting this. I hope my colleagues will do so as well. Thank you, Councilman Cashman. Seeing no other comments, I will just add that I grew up about four, maybe five blocks away from this house. This was my neighborhood. And while I did not spend 50 years in that community by my parents, did. They bought their house 50 years ago this year, 1969, for a whopping $10,500. And last time I was on the block, because they still live there. I was doing the math and about half of the houses on the block I grew up on are not there anymore. They've been torn down. And right across the street and a little bit to the left of my parents house, they tore down one else and they built the giant house in its place. And then they bought the house next door, tore it down to build a yard. So there's actually one fewer house even on the block than there was. And it is changing. It's not the same neighborhood that I grew up in, and it's certainly not the same neighborhood that it was when they bought their house. And so to be able to have a few structures in this neighborhood that we know will be preserved and will last as it is rapidly, rapidly being torn down is really special. And so I will add my thanks for your gift to our city and to our community, and I will be happy to support this this evening . Madam Secretary, roll call. Black CdeBaca. I Lynn. I. Hinds.

{"input": "Motion carries. Thank you. Item 23. Communication from Vice Mayor Richardson. Councilwoman in the House. Councilmember Urunga. Recommendation to refer to the government personnel and Elections Committee. To consider naming of the newly renovated North Health Facility, the Ronald Arias Health Equity Center, in recognition of the legacy, contributions and service of former Long Beach Director of Health and Human Services, Ronald Arias. Thank you. Let's get this over to Vice Mayor Richardson. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I wanted to just start by talking to a little bit of story history about the North health facility. This is a facility at Highland Park, not a great name, north health facility, used to have a youth child development center in there that closed years ago. The building was failing. Not a lot of investment in the building. And and so two years ago, we closed down the building, identified resources through grants and other sources to improve the facility. And it's a great opportunity to to engage in placemaking, I believe, in taking something that really didn't have an identity or not much of an identity and give it a location, give it a name. Given that identity that really reflects our community and becomes a place to be invested in and celebrating. We've done this with changing the North Library to the Michelle Obama Library, the Highland Park Community Center, the Doorstops, the other community center. It really gives an identity and character to help inspire the community. And so during that time, we had conversations about how we reinvent, reimagine Highland Park in general from just being a collection of buildings to really a complex that really celebrates the people of our community and offer current services to that community. And so in response to meetings calls, a major $5 million investment was made into the Highland Park, into the north health facility. And the focus is really health equity. And within our framework for reconciliation, reconciliation plan, go for strategy one. One potential added item is the need to invest in equitable health experiences and outcomes and exploring the creation of a community health center that connects existing programs and organizations as a network for holistic health approaches and patient navigation services. Ronald Arias Health Equity Center will be that center, and so this new center will feature a youth workforce center that did not exist, that happened in the past that focuses on things like reentry. It will have a clinic focused on sexual health for the community. It will have youth development programs, violence prevention programs, fatherhood initiative. A number of things that we're not present at the park in the past, and this is going to be a transformative impact. And, you know, I met Ron. I think Ron is the appropriate person to name this facility. After I met Ron, my first year as chief of staff for Councilman Steve Neal, and Ron came in. I remember the briefing. He already had a relationship with Councilman the I don't know how long or how far back, but Ron came in. He brought in Lori Ruska, Shawna Stevens, who was like right and left hand. And I hadn't known them, but they came in and said, hey, we want to talk about health equity in North Long Beach Community Health. Initially, it started with healthy corner stores. We organized around healthy corner stores that turned into the Alcohol Nuisance Abatement Ordinance and liquor store modernization program. Change that transforming liquor stores into healthy markets that ultimately developed into the hills on initiative. Initially, $1,000,000 investment from Kaiser Permanente into advancing health equity. In North Long Beach, we created the Coalition for Healthy North Long Beach together. We did a lot. Ron's legacy was really community health, investing in local communities to spur transformational change because a lot came out of that initial investment. And so Ron has contributed so much over his career to our city's public health and to health equity. And for that reason, I believe Ron embodies the character and legacy befitting of someone whose name belongs on a city building, particularly at Highland Park in North Long Beach. And so with that, I submit to the City Council the proposal to make, to create, to name the North Health Facility, the Ron Arias Ronald Arias Health Equity Center. Thank you. Okay. Councilman Noriega. Thank you, Vice Mayor. That was a. Awesome presentation in terms of what what you're doing out there. And of course, that facility has provided so much service in the north Long Beach area that is very much needed. Point of history. I when I worked with Sea Long Beach, I was the assistant, the administrative officer for the Health Department. So I used to go to that facility quite a bit to talk to employees and see the programs that were there. And the the black health the black infant health program was stationed out there. And so I would go out there a lot to talk to people, look at the kids, and the facility was in quite a bit of disrepair and a congratulations to you to getting the funding to make those very significant improvements. In regards to the naming of the round, our Audience Health Equity Center I think is very appropriate since Ron was the executive director for many years and I think it was around 15, 20 years that he was director of the health department there and was the main proponent for a lot of the programs that were there, a lot of the funding that came to the health department. For those of you out there who might not know, our health department is 95% grant funded. So there's very little actual city funds to grant general fund money that goes into the health department for the little programs that come out of there, whether it's in the in the facility center, there's a center also in Admiral in Admiral Kidd Park and one at a at a martin Luther King Park, MLK. So those those facilities provide a lot of different services as we go into the community. But the but the naming of this facility here in Ronald's name, I think is very appropriate in the sense that there's a lot of healthy programs that go out of that facility. And a brief resume on Ron is that he did have a lot to do with equity, a lot to do with employment for kids or youth, provided a lot of services in Long Beach in general. Even before he became the director of the Health and Human Services Department. He was one of the founders of the the La Raza Neighborhood Center, which was which then later became the UCC center. He was very much involved in, in, in tobacco education when he worked for the I was at the Cancer Society. I think it was forget the name the leaves me right now. But a lot of what he's done has been involved with health and involved with assistance for the community and working in neighborhoods that required a lot of a lot of help and a lot of assistance and a lot of grant funding which he was able to bring. And he brought it through the health department. So I'm very happy and pleased and honored actually to be able to second this motion and looking forward for it to go through the government personnel and Elections Committee for further consideration. And I'm sure that once they hear the complete background of Mr. Arias, there will be no question as to the appropriateness of naming this facility after after such a wonderful person, a great man for Long Beach. Thank you. Thank you, councilman and House. Thank you very much. Thank you, Vice Mayor, for recognizing the importance of naming such a fitting project, such a fitting, you know, felt health center at heart at your park by the name of Ronald. Ah, yes. I think he is so perfect for this. He's been a leader in our community for so many years, and I think that projects like this really give us an opportunity to honor our Long Beach leaders. And Mr. Arias has definitely been that for our city as a whole. So I thank you and congratulate you at the same time. Thank you. Councilwoman Sara. You Mayor. I also want to express what a good call this is, Vice Mayor, for naming this unit in our facility to the run areas health equity center. You know, speaking of his youth work, that's actually the first time I met Ron was probably back in 2000. I want to say eight or nine when I was the executive director of my Girls in Action. You know, me being a new ed and getting to know all of the various ways to work in partnership with the city, and here he was, the director of a department inviting me and my staff at that time to come and meet with his staff, all of the department directors. And it was just really, I think, a demonstration of how much he is a champion for ensuring that he includes young people as well as working with and partnership truly with everyone. So I just want to, you know, also thank council member Urunga and Sun House for signing on to this. And I think this is a great honor for him and I think overall for the community. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Mongo. Thank you. I just wanted to say a few words of support and just talk about that. When Ron brought forward solutions, they weren't always the easiest solutions. We really thought about comprehensive ways to reach out and go into the community, out to council members to find a way to make a long term difference. And I think that naming something after him because of the impact he made on the city is a really great move. Thank you. Last May, Richardson. Just before we go to public comment, just want to acknowledge this community letter. So I want to thank the public for this community letter organized by the steering committee. Honorable Steven Neal, Susanna Edmond, Mario Gonzalez, Jessica Quintana and Shanna Stephens. The steering committee and a total of 25 leaders, including former city managers, community leaders, every elected official in the north, the you know, that represents the area surrounding this, the center, our community members. And so I want to just acknowledge their support and thank you for sending that letter. Thank you. I know we have just got Quintana who has a comment and she just comes up and is going to say a few remarks. I think this is a very fitting tribute to someone that is really the the father of the modern health department that we have here at the city of Long Beach. And also just a mentor to so many people across the city, including myself. I'm very grateful that Ron led this health department with the passion for for the city that he did. I him and Phyllis are two of just the kindest, most generous people that we have. And I'm just very grateful to to both of them for their service to to our community. Ron Arias is not just really a legend in the health world. Sure. Locally, but also for the Latino community. He is someone of significant contributions. He, as a young student and as an activist, was raising issues for the Chicano and Latino community, as a as a young college student, as moving on as a as a health specialist, as an activist, ensuring that the city was meeting goals around equity when there weren't a lot of managers and folks in his and leading departments that were that were people of color and certainly Latinos at the time. And so I think Ron is a very loved in our community among all people. And and I'm really, I think touched that vice mayor, that you and the community in North Long Beach are active in getting this across the finish line. And we also gave Ron the key to the city not that long ago and well deserved for him and his family. And he's just a fantastic person. So I'm very, very happy to support this. And with that, Miss Quintana. Definitely. Thank you so much. Parker Garcia and city council members. And this is just I mean, on behalf of center chair in our board of. Directors. And the Latino community, we can't say enough about Ron. You know, definitely want to borrow that key to the city from him one day. But he's he's just been a champion in public health, among so many other things. You know, upon his retirement, Ron never retired. He continued to stay active, a diligent in the community serving on the Miller Health Foundation. He serves on our Latino Cultural Advisory Committee. Ron is as an advisor, you know, to all of our community organizations in the city. You know, he works diligently fundraising for the Rancho for the Assistance League. Yes. And he started the Latin managers professional organization because it does believe in education and really developing our young people to become in higher education and taking manager positions. So we're delighted. Thank you, Councilmember Richardson, for bringing this forward. Definitely. You know, the North Long Beach area needs support and needs health and human services in the area. They have high needs, you know, as well as other areas in the city of Long Beach. So thank you for having the opportunity to speak. And this is very, very just you know, we're all really excited for Ron and his family. And as you said, Mayor Garcia, they do a lot for this city. It should be the Ron and Phyllis Center, actually, because Phyllis is his pillar. She supports him so much. And so thank you so much. We truly appreciate this. Thank you. And with that, we have a motion and a second. Members, please go ahead and cast your vote. Motion carries. Thank you.

{"input": "12 Eyes Council Bill 728 House Pass. Congratulations, Councilwoman Gilmore, will you please put Council Bill 729 on the floor? Yes, Mr. President. I move that council bill 729 be placed upon final consideration and do pass. It has been moved and seconded. Public hearing for Council Bill 729 is now open. May we have the staff report? Andrew Webb, welcome. Thank you. Mr. President. Councilors, will this open up here? Thank you. Andrew Webb here with Community Planning and Development to present on this request to rezone two parcels at 1414 36 South Irving from PWD 180 to SMU three. That's a suburban neighborhood context residential multi-unit, up to three stories. This request is in Council District three. It is in the Marley neighborhood near the intersection of Florida Avenue and Federal Boulevard. The site is currently occupied by five three story apartment buildings and one single family home. And hopefully, as you can see in this aerial here, it is comprised of two parcels. The surrounding zoning here is a mix of single and multi-unit residential. There are quite a few instances of the SMU three zoned on nearby properties. Land uses in the area are primarily residential, with a mix of single and multi-unit development. Commercial land uses. Federal Boulevard there to the east and to the south is a church with a school and a child care center. As you can see in this area, all the multi-unit development immediately to the north of the site is very similar in scale and layout, built in a suburban form with apartments arranged around internal parking and open space. This next slide shows a couple of views of the site. The top looking northwest along Irving and at the bottom southwest along Arkansas. These photos show the house at the northwest corner of the subject site, as well as the multi-unit development to the north. And then this photo shows single unit development to the west of the subject site. So the existing planned unit development, or PUD Zone District, was established in 1985 after the apartment complex had already been built. Permits 116 residential units on site and calls for three storey buildings with setbacks, landscaping and other design standards. Essentially, based on what existed at the time, the PD also specified that a commercial use that was in operation on the single family home in the single family home at the time of adoption could continue. The current PD 180 is the second PD established on the site. The first was PD three, which was adopted in 1978 when the owner at the time wanted to seek a redevelopment of the property. PD three was based on plans for five apartment clusters, each of which were to contain 22 one bedroom units and one two bedroom unit for a total of 115 units, plus the single unit house . Building permits were issued in 1980 and 81 for the five structures. Some of them listed the total number of units at 23, some listed at at 24, and some had a number scratched out without any explanation or replacement figure. No subsequent building permits for renovations or reconfigurations were found in city records, and staff believes that the five structures were built at that time with 24 one bedroom units for a total of 120 apartment units. The slide shows some of those building permits. And you can see that there are differences and discrepancies between the number of units each each structure could contain. So in 1985, the apartment developer realized that the map for PD three I'm sorry, for PD one three had emitted the single unit house, which had been envisioned early on as like a manager's unit or some other amenity for apartment residents. So I proposed a new. PDP 8180. That would did add the single unit house at the corner of Arkansas and Irving into the boundary. But the documentation was not updated to show the actual number of units on the site. The development was the apartment complex was recently acquired by a new owner who learned late last year that from the city that the properties existing improvements were not in conformance with the plan unit development zoning. Due to this discrepancy between the number of units specified in the number of units actually built on site. This slide does show shows some of the language from PD one A.D., including the reason for its adoption and the maximum number of units shown at 116 year. So as I mentioned upfront, the applicant proposes to rezone the property from the current PUD to SAMU three. That's a multi-unit residential zone in the suburban neighborhood context. This neighborhood context is characterized by single and multi-unit development with lower building heights, larger lots and deeper setbacks than the city's urban neighborhood context. With regard to the process to date that this request was considered by the Planning Board on June 7th and the land use and transportation or land use, Transportation and Infrastructure Committee on June 27, both of which recommended approval. Staff has received several inquiries about the application, but no public comments. As you're aware, to approve a rezoning, the Council must find that these five criteria established by the Denver Zoning Code are met with regard to consistency with adopted plans to plan impact the subject site. The Comprehensive Plan and Blueprint Denver staff finds that this proposed rezoning would further several comprehensive plan objectives and goals, including preservation of existing housing stock, support for affordable rental housing, near transit services such as those available on federal nearby, and recommendations to simplify and update the city's land use and regulatory system whenever possible. Blueprint, Denver established a single family residential concept land use for this area as described in detail in the staff report. Staff considers this proposed rezoning to be consistent with that concept land use because it allows the continued operation and reinvestment in an existing residential use and would actually reduce the opportunities for commercial uses on the site. With regard to the other criteria, this request will result in the uniform application of building form, use and design regulations for the SMU three zone district. It will further the public welfare by enabling the continuing operation and maintenance of affordable multi-unit housing, by establishing regulations for future redevelopment to create safe, active pedestrian spaces, thereby implementing adopted land use plans and policies. Staff agrees with the applicant's proposed justifying circumstance as the existing PUD adopted in 1985 should have accurately reflected the number of units on site that at the time of its adoption. And finally, staff finds that the proposed rezoning is consistent with the surrounding suburban neighborhood context. So with that, CPD recommends approval based on a finding that all review criteria have been met. And I'd be happy to answer any questions. All right, thank you, Andrew. Appreciate it. All right. We have two speakers this evening. If they would come up when their name is called and you have 3 minutes each, we have Mark Lampert and Chairman Sekou. Again. Good evening. My name is Mark Lippert. I'm here on behalf of the ownership and applicants Parkwood Plaza, and I work with the owner, Mark Venegas. And during our due diligence process late last year, we discovered this discrepancy between the number of units that exist at the property and the number of units that the current zoning calls out . So we're here tonight to address that zoning issue and bring the property back into compliance and answer any other further questions. Great. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Stay cool. Yes. Once again, Chairman Sekou Blackstar Action Movement, advocacy group for poor, working, poor, homeless and senior citizens. We support the journey. We support the zoning change for a couple of reasons. One. From since I've been coming down here for the last almost ten years advocating for. Our constituency. What has become evidently clear is that the zoning is crazy. And it's antiquated. And city council is always coming up with at the moment seeing contradictions and then trying to smooth the path so that the process is fair. And so we think that this is a fair process that in order to be consistent with the zoning, that this is necessary to approve it. And also suggests to city council that a review be done of all zoning stuff that's inconsistent and make that into a package so that people don't have to spend inordinate amounts of money trying to straighten out city council business that should have been straightened out a long time ago. It's unfair. Persistence is also unfair for you guys have to go through that and spend time with that. So in addition to that, I just want to suggest to the folks who are anticipating these different projects, especially for our folks that we represent rapidly. Black folks are becoming an endangered species in this town. The neighborhood that I grew up in for 67 years at five points is now 72% white. And I know many times we talk about the gentrification and the unintentional consequences. But at some point, you know, it's very interesting to find out in order to. Abort a moral code. We come up with these terms like Donald Trump alternative facts. And the truth is we can no longer turn our back. So we suggest for folks who are doing these development projects, and I know it doesn't have much to do with the zoning that you're not required to do any of this. Anticipate the possibility that for us to be able to live in this town, we have to be able to work in this town. And we have plenty of skilled labor. Councilperson President is working with unions and whatnot to develop a better skill test of plumbers and pipefitters and those kind of things. And over time. And so there are plenty of folks who have skills. Who aren't even considered or when they show up to apply for these jobs. Their applications thrown in the trash. Now, folks call that one thing. Other folks call that the other thing. But the real deal, we're talking about a systematic and it needs to stop if we're talking about diversity in this town, which includes black people. And I say that unapologetically. They deserve the same opportunities as other people in this town to work in this town and make this their home. Thank you very much. Chairman Cycle, your time is up. Thank you, sir. All right. This concludes our speakers for the evening. Questions by members of council. All right. The hearing, public hearing for council Bill 729 is now closed. Comments by members of Council. Guzman-Lopez I believe this is in your district. Yes, it is. Thank you, Mr. President. So, first of all, I mean, I mean, thank you for doing this. So this came it was brought to our attention because it was out of compliance. And rather than having them go through all kinds of or all kinds of craziness, so to speak, you know, this this district was proposed just to kind of bring it back into compliance. But also, you know, here's here's one of the things I remember and one of the previous counsels sitting on some of these pads are so restrictive, they're not they don't know. They some of them were created in error, not anticipating growth, not anticipating the neighborhoods around them as they developed. And when you look at this property, the important thing about this property, you know, I appreciate one of the speakers speaking about this, but. Is that it is. Are you one of the few remaining original apartments that are still affordable? This is still affordable housing. It's not new, but it's affordable. And some of these some of these units, some of these pads, the apartments, like they're spread out, spread throughout the city as they've aged and they've stayed in their pod in the world around them and the zoning world around them. And the land use around them has changed. Right. And to the point where they're obsolete. And so instead of watching this go down an abyss of of being obsolete or having them struggle as as they not only improve the units, but improve the living standards and do maintenance , it's important that we keep up with it. And so I here's the thing. There are a lot of these different pads around this the city, a lot of these kind of apartments scattered around the city. Not all of them have been brought to our attention. But I really appreciate this one being brought to our attention. It's an important part of our neighborhood, and I know this real intimately because I had an uncle and aunt that lived here, had had neighbors that lived here, and there's some awesome little apartments, but they do need upgrading. And in order to do that, we have you have to have you have to come in. You have to bring it into conformity. So. Mr. President, without further ado, I support this rezoning, and I think it's something that is a long time overdue. So it's the right zoned district. It's not asking for anything else, just to just to come into compliance. I agree. Thank you, Councilman Lopez. See no other comments, Madam Secretary, roll call. Lopez. I know you. Took a drink.
