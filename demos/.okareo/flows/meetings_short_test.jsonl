In this case, FHA was not the landlord. The FHA was only the voucher administrator. The court decided, based on a plain reading of the language in the Seattle Municipal Court, in the statutory context, supporting the legislative intent to cover only the landlord tenant relationship. It did not apply to FHA in its role as a voucher administrator. The court noted in its decision that if the city wishes to and extend the unfair practice requirement to include a requirement that Section eight program administrators like FHA making a reasonable accommodation when requested, it can amend the SC accordingly.

Apparently, we've had a problem over there with some thievery of copper wire. And so I'm hoping that there can be some budgeting for some security because there's obviously remaining facilities we don't want vandalized because it's a very important structure. And I want to thank the city manager and city staff. This has been a long, long process, but I think it's one that's going to serve the city of Long Beach very well. It's going to save the city tremendous amount of money because we are going to have an east side police station where we don't have to pay rent.

But essentially this particular amendment is what I would call a clean up amendment. It would clarify what an act of voyeurism is and that it occurs under circumstances where a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy in a public place. The intent of this particular amendment is to provide clarity to individuals regarding prohibited conduct by including language from the state statute that has already been upheld by our state courts as being constitutional, and also to ensure consistent application of the state and local laws prohibiting voyeurism in public places. One notable thing is that this will this amendment does not change any of the existing penalties under our ordinance.
